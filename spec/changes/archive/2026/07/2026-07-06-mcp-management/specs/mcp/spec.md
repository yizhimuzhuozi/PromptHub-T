# MCP Management Spec

## Added Requirements

### Requirement: Local MCP Library

PromptHub MUST maintain a local MCP library containing normalized server definitions. The library is the source of truth for the MCP management UI.

#### Scenario: Create a stdio MCP server

- **GIVEN** the user enters a name and command
- **WHEN** the server is saved
- **THEN** PromptHub stores a normalized stdio MCP server with string args/env values and generated timestamps

#### Scenario: Read MCP library without mutation

- **GIVEN** the local MCP library already contains server timestamps
- **WHEN** PromptHub reads or normalizes the library
- **THEN** existing `createdAt` and `updatedAt` values remain unchanged unless the user performs a real mutation

#### Scenario: Migrate legacy MCP library path on first read

- **GIVEN** a user has an MCP library at the legacy `config/mcp-library.json` path
- **AND** `data/mcp/library.json` does not exist yet
- **WHEN** PromptHub reads the MCP library
- **THEN** PromptHub MUST normalize the legacy library into `data/mcp/library.json`
- **AND** the legacy file remains available as a compatibility backup

#### Scenario: Save personal MCP notes

- **GIVEN** the user edits personal notes from a My MCP detail page
- **WHEN** PromptHub saves the notes
- **THEN** PromptHub persists `notes` on the local MCP library server record
- **AND** the notes are not projected into external agent target config files

### Requirement: Target-Specific Projection

PromptHub MUST project normalized MCP servers into the target agent's config shape.

#### Scenario: Project to Codex

- **GIVEN** a stdio MCP server named `playwright`
- **WHEN** the user previews Codex config
- **THEN** PromptHub returns TOML under `[mcp_servers.playwright]`

#### Scenario: Project to mcpServers JSON

- **GIVEN** enabled MCP servers
- **WHEN** the user previews Claude, Cursor, Cline, Gemini, Windsurf, Kiro, or custom JSON config
- **THEN** PromptHub returns a JSON object with `mcpServers`

#### Scenario: Project to OpenCode project config

- **GIVEN** a registered PromptHub project with root path `/workspace/app`
- **WHEN** PromptHub builds visible MCP targets
- **THEN** it includes an OpenCode workspace target at `/workspace/app/opencode.json`
- **AND** applying MCP servers writes OpenCode's `mcp` object shape into that file

#### Scenario: Project to Kiro workspace config

- **GIVEN** a registered PromptHub project with root path `/workspace/app`
- **WHEN** PromptHub builds visible MCP targets
- **THEN** it includes a Kiro workspace target at `/workspace/app/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`
- **AND** applying MCP servers writes the standard `mcpServers` object shape into that file

#### Scenario: Project to Kilo Code project config

- **GIVEN** a registered PromptHub project with root path `/workspace/app`
- **WHEN** PromptHub builds visible MCP targets
- **THEN** it includes one default Kilo Code workspace target at `/workspace/app/kilo.json`
- **AND** applying MCP servers writes Kilo Code's `mcp` object shape into that file
- **AND** reading Kilo Code JSONC configs tolerates comments and trailing commas

#### Scenario: Project to Tencent WorkBuddy configs

- **GIVEN** a registered PromptHub project with root path `/workspace/app`
- **WHEN** PromptHub builds visible MCP targets
- **THEN** it includes a WorkBuddy workspace target at `/workspace/app/.workbuddy/mcp.json`
- **AND** the global WorkBuddy preset points at `~/.workbuddy/mcp.json`
- **AND** applying MCP servers writes the standard `mcpServers` object shape into those files

#### Scenario: Project to CodeBuddy configs

- **GIVEN** a registered PromptHub project with root path `/workspace/app`
- **WHEN** PromptHub builds visible MCP targets
- **THEN** it includes a CodeBuddy workspace target at `/workspace/app/.mcp.json`
- **AND** the global CodeBuddy preset points at `~/.codebuddy/.mcp.json`
- **AND** applying MCP servers writes the standard `mcpServers` object shape into those files

#### Scenario: Keep Agent MCP and Project MCP separate

- **GIVEN** registered PromptHub projects derive project-level MCP targets
- **WHEN** the user opens Agent MCP
- **THEN** PromptHub shows only global Agent MCP targets
- **AND** project-level OpenCode, Kiro, and Kilo Code targets are not shown there
- **WHEN** the user opens Project MCP from the left navigation
- **THEN** PromptHub shows the registered project MCP targets
- **AND** Kilo Code appears as one platform entry instead of JSON/JSONC/path variants

#### Scenario: Omit unsupported Roo Code target

- **GIVEN** PromptHub builds the built-in MCP target preset list
- **WHEN** the preset list is returned to desktop UI, IPC, or CLI flows
- **THEN** it MUST NOT include `Roo Code` / `roo`
- **AND** legacy `roo` target bindings in the local MCP library are ignored on read

#### Scenario: Project to VS Code

- **GIVEN** enabled MCP servers
- **WHEN** the user previews VS Code config
- **THEN** PromptHub returns a JSON object with `servers`

### Requirement: Safe Apply

PromptHub MUST apply MCP config by merging only the managed server entries into the selected target file and preserving unrelated settings.

#### Scenario: Existing user config

- **GIVEN** a target config file already contains unrelated keys
- **WHEN** the user applies one MCP server
- **THEN** unrelated keys remain and a backup file is created before the write

#### Scenario: Same-name external target config conflict

- **GIVEN** a target config file already contains a same-name MCP entry that PromptHub has not recorded as distributed to that target
- **WHEN** the user applies a PromptHub MCP server with that name
- **THEN** PromptHub rejects the write by default and leaves the target file unchanged

#### Scenario: Confirmed overwrite

- **GIVEN** the user explicitly confirms overwrite in the UI or passes `--force` in the CLI
- **WHEN** PromptHub applies a same-name MCP server
- **THEN** PromptHub creates a backup, atomically replaces the target file, and reports which server names were overwritten

#### Scenario: Reapply managed entry

- **GIVEN** PromptHub previously recorded a server binding for the same target path
- **WHEN** the user reapplies the same MCP server to that target
- **THEN** PromptHub may replace the managed entry without requiring force

#### Scenario: Disabled server apply guard

- **GIVEN** the selected MCP servers are all disabled
- **WHEN** the user or API attempts to apply them to an agent target
- **THEN** PromptHub rejects the write, leaves the target file unchanged, and does not record a target binding

#### Scenario: Settings-disabled platform cannot be selected for MCP distribution

- **GIVEN** Settings contains a platform id in `disabledPlatformIds`
- **WHEN** the user opens My MCP, Agent MCP, or a batch MCP distribution dialog
- **THEN** targets whose `platformId` matches that disabled id MUST be hidden from selection and counts
- **AND** a stale open dialog MUST NOT apply to that target after it becomes hidden

#### Scenario: Invalid target config parse failure

- **GIVEN** an existing target config file cannot be parsed
- **WHEN** PromptHub attempts to apply MCP servers to that target
- **THEN** PromptHub rejects the write before creating a backup or modifying any target file or binding

#### Scenario: Remove Codex TOML server child sections

- **GIVEN** a Codex TOML target config contains `[mcp_servers.<name>]` and nested sections such as `[mcp_servers.<name>.tools.<tool>]`
- **WHEN** PromptHub removes that MCP server from the target
- **THEN** PromptHub removes both the root server section and every nested server child section
- **AND** similarly named servers such as `<name>-extra` remain untouched

### Requirement: MCP Environment Scope

PromptHub MUST treat MCP environment variables as server-level configuration values stored on the local MCP server record.

#### Scenario: Reuse across agent targets

- **GIVEN** one PromptHub MCP server has env values configured
- **WHEN** the user distributes it to multiple agent targets
- **THEN** the same server-level env values are projected into each selected target config

#### Scenario: No global process mutation

- **GIVEN** the user edits or imports MCP env values in PromptHub
- **WHEN** PromptHub saves those values
- **THEN** PromptHub must update only the MCP library record and must not mutate the operating system environment

### Requirement: Static MCP Health Checks

PromptHub MUST report static configuration issues without pretending to perform live MCP or provider authentication checks.

#### Scenario: Known environment value format warning

- **GIVEN** a saved MCP server has known provider environment variables such as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` or `SLACK_TEAM_ID`
- **WHEN** those values are filled with strings that do not match the expected token or id shape
- **THEN** the MCP health check status is `warning`
- **AND** the issues include `INVALID_ENV_VALUE` for the invalid fields
- **AND** the UI must not label those values as healthy only because they are non-empty

#### Scenario: Static check wording

- **GIVEN** the user runs an MCP health check
- **WHEN** PromptHub reports the result
- **THEN** the result copy must describe a static configuration check rather than a live provider connectivity check

### Requirement: My MCP Library Management

PromptHub MUST expose My MCP as a Skill-style manageable library, not only a passive card gallery.

#### Scenario: Switch library density

- **GIVEN** the user is viewing My MCP
- **WHEN** the user switches between Gallery View and List View
- **THEN** PromptHub renders the same filtered MCP servers in the selected view mode with card or row detail entry actions
- **AND** List View uses the same row-first layout as My Skill List View instead of wrapping rows inside a separate card container

#### Scenario: Quick sync one MCP server

- **GIVEN** a saved MCP server is visible on a My MCP card or list row
- **WHEN** the user clicks the quick sync action
- **THEN** PromptHub opens the MCP batch sync dialog scoped to that single MCP server
- **AND** applying the dialog writes only that MCP server ID through the existing safe MCP apply flow

#### Scenario: Wrap crowded gallery-card distribution indicators

- **GIVEN** a My MCP or My Skill gallery card is distributed to many agent platforms
- **WHEN** PromptHub renders the card header
- **THEN** platform indicators wrap within the card instead of overflowing past the card boundary
- **AND** card action buttons render on a separate right-aligned row so download, favorite, and delete actions remain visible

#### Scenario: Paginate large MCP libraries

- **GIVEN** the filtered My MCP result has more entries than the current page size
- **WHEN** the My MCP page renders
- **THEN** PromptHub shows the current item range, total count, page-size selector, and previous/next pagination controls
- **AND** only the current page entries are rendered in the gallery or list body

#### Scenario: Favorite MCP servers

- **GIVEN** a saved MCP server is visible in My MCP
- **WHEN** the user toggles its favorite action from the card, list row, or batch toolbar
- **THEN** PromptHub persists `isFavorite` on that MCP server in the local MCP library
- **AND** the Favorites filter reflects the persisted value after reload

#### Scenario: Batch manage MCP tags

- **GIVEN** the user selects one or more MCP servers in My MCP batch mode
- **WHEN** the user adds or removes a tag through the batch tag dialog
- **THEN** PromptHub updates each selected MCP server's `tags` through the local MCP library update flow
- **AND** the batch toolbar, dialog, and result copy are localized for every supported desktop locale

#### Scenario: Filter My MCP from the shared sidebar tag section

- **GIVEN** saved MCP servers have tags in the local MCP library
- **WHEN** the user views My MCP
- **THEN** PromptHub renders those tags in the shared left-bottom sidebar tag section, matching My Skills

- **AND** clicking a sidebar tag filters the My MCP library by that tag

#### Scenario: Batch sync MCP servers to agent platforms

- **GIVEN** the user selects enabled MCP servers in My MCP batch mode
- **WHEN** the user opens batch sync and applies the selected agent targets
- **THEN** PromptHub applies the selected MCP server IDs to every selected target through the existing safe MCP apply flow
- **AND** disabled selected MCP servers are skipped instead of being written to target config files

#### Scenario: Add saved MCP servers to an Agent

- **GIVEN** the user opens Add from My MCP inside Agent MCP
- **WHEN** PromptHub renders saved MCP servers for the selected Agent target
- **THEN** the dialog uses the same selectable card-grid layout as the existing Skill install dialog
- **AND** clicking a card toggles selection while disabled or already-distributed servers remain unavailable
- **AND** the confirm action remains a footer action below the card grid

#### Scenario: Select detail distribution targets from whole cards

- **GIVEN** the user is viewing the My MCP full detail distribution sidebar
- **WHEN** the user clicks a non-distributed agent platform card body
- **THEN** PromptHub toggles that target selection without requiring the user to hit only the small checkbox icon
- **AND** the selected targets are applied through the existing safe MCP apply flow

#### Scenario: Render MCP detail preview as a single-column flow

- **GIVEN** the user opens a saved MCP server detail page
- **WHEN** PromptHub renders the Preview tab
- **THEN** the detail, health, environment, source, notes, and platform integration sections render in one vertical detail flow
- **AND** the page must not use a desktop-only right sidebar layout for the platform panel

#### Scenario: Hide redundant custom target form in detail distribution

- **GIVEN** the user is viewing the My MCP full detail distribution sidebar
- **WHEN** PromptHub renders the platform integration panel
- **THEN** the panel shows built-in agent target cards and the single selected-target apply action
- **AND** it does not show a separate custom target path form or a second apply button below the platform cards

#### Scenario: Drag MCP sources into My MCP

- **GIVEN** the user is viewing the My MCP library
- **WHEN** the user drags and drops a local MCP config file or local source folder onto the library surface
- **THEN** PromptHub imports the dropped filesystem path through the same MCP source creation flow used by the New MCP source picker
- **AND** the import adds the detected MCP entries to My MCP without changing the MCP library storage contract

#### Scenario: Show list distribution progress

- **GIVEN** the user switches My MCP to List View
- **WHEN** MCP rows render
- **THEN** each row shows detected target platform indicators and a distributed-count / total-target-count summary matching the My Skill list pattern

#### Scenario: Delete MCP servers from cards or batches

- **GIVEN** one or more MCP servers are selected or visible on a card/list row
- **WHEN** the user requests deletion
- **THEN** PromptHub shows an in-app destructive confirmation dialog
- **AND** confirming deletes the selected MCP servers through the same local library delete flow used by MCP detail pages

### Requirement: MCP Store Catalog Channels

PromptHub MUST provide MCP Store channels backed by real catalog data. PromptHub Official Store MUST stay first and is reserved for PromptHub-owned marketplace content; third-party/community channels MUST NOT be populated with local placeholder templates that appear to come from those communities.

#### Scenario: Install a market template

- **GIVEN** the user chooses a marketplace template
- **WHEN** the template is installed
- **THEN** the library contains an editable MCP server copied from the template

#### Scenario: Inspect a market template before install

- **GIVEN** the user opens an MCP Store template detail modal
- **WHEN** the template is not yet installed
- **THEN** the install action is rendered in the modal footer like the existing Skill install flow
- **AND** the detail content is rendered as a single-column flow
- **AND** source, documentation, repository, and trust metadata are shown inline as a normal detail section rather than a separate right-side column
- **AND** installed-state labels use localized shared copy in every supported desktop locale

#### Scenario: Browse preconfigured MCP stores

- **AND** PromptHub does not show local placeholder templates or fake counts for third-party sources

#### Scenario: Select an MCP Store source from the left sidebar

- **GIVEN** PromptHub has preconfigured Official Store and MCP Registry stores
- **WHEN** the user opens MCP Store
- **THEN** the top-level MCP Store menu does not show a template count badge
- **AND** the left sidebar shows each preconfigured store channel directly without an `All Sources` pseudo-channel
- **AND** each third-party source count is derived from `remoteMarketEntries`, not from bundled local templates
- **AND** the right content area title, description, and cards are scoped to the selected store channel
- **AND** the right content area does not render a duplicate market-source chip/button filter bar

#### Scenario: Load real remote MCP store catalogs

- **GIVEN** the user opens a preconfigured MCP Store source
- **WHEN** PromptHub loads the source catalog
- **THEN** PromptHub resolves the selected source catalog from that source's own configured channel instead of showing a mixed global catalog
- **AND** Official Store may be empty until PromptHub publishes an official MCP marketplace catalog
- **AND** MCP Registry entries are parsed from the official `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io` JSON API
- **AND** search queries are applied to the selected source catalog
- **AND** third-party channels do not fall back to bundled local templates on load failure or empty remote results

#### Scenario: Show remote loading before first catalog page resolves

- **GIVEN** the user opens or switches to a remote MCP Store source with no cached result for the current search query
- **WHEN** PromptHub starts loading that source catalog
- **THEN** the right content area shows the remote loading state
- **AND** it MUST NOT show the empty-state heading or empty hint until the first catalog request resolves or fails

#### Scenario: Use user-facing MCP Store empty copy

- **GIVEN** a selected MCP Store source returns no visible server entries
- **WHEN** PromptHub renders the empty state
- **THEN** the copy describes the selected source as having no MCP servers available
- **AND** the copy MUST NOT expose internal implementation terms such as local placeholders, fake templates, fallback catalogs, or mirroring behavior

#### Scenario: Continue a paginated remote MCP catalog

- **GIVEN** a remote MCP Store response includes `nextCursor`
- **WHEN** the user scrolls near the bottom of that store or activates the load-more action
- **THEN** PromptHub loads the next page with that cursor
- **AND** it appends new templates to the selected source/query cache without removing the already loaded templates
- **AND** duplicate templates are collapsed by template identity
- **AND** concurrent continuation loads for the same selected source are ignored
- **AND** if the user remains near the bottom after that page is appended and the source still has `nextCursor`, PromptHub continues loading the next page without requiring a second scroll gesture

#### Scenario: Show total and loaded counts separately

- **GIVEN** a remote MCP Store source returns a catalog count and a paginated result set
- **WHEN** PromptHub renders the MCP Store header or left source list
- **THEN** the source count represents the remote total or known lower-bound total, not only the visible cards
- **AND** the right catalog header separately shows how many templates have been loaded into the current source/query cache
- **AND** lower-bound totals with more cursor pages are marked with `+`

#### Scenario: Search a remote MCP Store source

- **GIVEN** the user searches inside a selected remote MCP Store source
- **WHEN** the source supports a search parameter
- **THEN** PromptHub sends the search term to that source's remote catalog endpoint
- **AND** it stores the result under the selected source/query cache key
- **AND** load-more requests continue using the same search term and cursor

#### Scenario: Delegate source-specific remote search

- **WHEN** the user searches for a term
- **THEN** PromptHub requests the registry API with the `search` query parameter
- **AND** it must not locally filter the already server-searched response again

#### Scenario: Respect remote pagination capabilities

- **GIVEN** the selected remote source returns a continuation cursor such as MCP Registry `metadata.nextCursor`
- **WHEN** the user scrolls near the bottom or activates load more
- **THEN** PromptHub requests the next page with the cursor and appends the returned entries
- **GIVEN** the selected remote source does not expose a stable pagination cursor or next-page marker
- **WHEN** the user scrolls near the bottom
- **THEN** PromptHub must not invent local pages from already loaded content
- **AND** it may show only the remotely returned page until the source exposes a stable continuation mechanism

#### Scenario: Localize MCP Store remote copy

- **GIVEN** the user opens MCP Store in any supported desktop locale
- **WHEN** PromptHub renders source descriptions, search placeholders, loading states, load-more copy, error copy, counts, and empty states
- **THEN** all user-facing copy comes from the `mcp` locale namespace
- **AND** Chinese and other non-English locales must not fall back to English strings such as `Search MCP servers...` or `Loading remote catalog...`

#### Scenario: Install a remote MCP store result

- **GIVEN** an MCP Store card came from a remote catalog response rather than the built-in template list
- **WHEN** the user installs that card from the detail modal
- **THEN** PromptHub installs the full template payload into the local MCP library
- **AND** the install flow does not require the remote result id to exist in the built-in static template registry

### Requirement: Custom MCP Source Creation

PromptHub MUST let users add custom MCP servers from commands, remote URLs, GitHub repositories, local source folders, existing MCP config files, and pasted MCP config content.

#### Scenario: Choose MCP creation method first

#### Scenario: Add from a remote MCP URL

- **GIVEN** the user pastes a non-repository HTTP URL
- **WHEN** PromptHub creates an MCP from that source
- **THEN** PromptHub stores a streamable HTTP MCP server with the URL

#### Scenario: Add from local source folder

- **GIVEN** the user selects or drops a local source folder
- **WHEN** the folder contains `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or `Dockerfile`
- **THEN** PromptHub infers an editable stdio MCP command without installing dependencies or executing project code

#### Scenario: Add by dropping config file

- **GIVEN** the user drops an MCP JSON or Codex TOML config file into the New MCP modal

- **AND** selecting saved My MCP servers writes only those selected server IDs into the selected Agent target config through the safe MCP apply flow
- **AND** the Agent MCP footer must not open the New MCP/source/manual creation flow
- **AND** the footer does not expose preview or bulk-apply actions that can write every enabled MCP server into the selected agent config

#### Scenario: Agent overview card action icons stay consistent

- **GIVEN** an Agent MCP target entry card is rendered
- **WHEN** the card shows config, import/open, and uninstall shortcut icons
- **THEN** the shortcuts use one consistent icon-button size, radius, border treatment, and hover behavior, with only semantic color variants for primary and destructive actions

#### Scenario: Open selected agent config from card action

- **GIVEN** an Agent MCP target entry card is rendered
- **WHEN** the user clicks the config-file shortcut

## Modified Requirements

### Desktop Home Modules

The desktop home module set MUST include MCP beside prompt, skill, and rules, and persisted module visibility/order MUST normalize legacy settings safely.

### Skill Library Cards

My Skill gallery cards SHOULD expose quick distribution indicators for the agent platforms where each Skill is already installed, matching the My MCP card pattern.

#### Scenario: Show distributed agents on Skill cards

- **GIVEN** a Skill is installed into one or more detected agent platforms
- **WHEN** PromptHub renders that Skill in the My Skill gallery
