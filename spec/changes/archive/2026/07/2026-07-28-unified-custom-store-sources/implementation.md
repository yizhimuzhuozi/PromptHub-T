# Implementation Log

## Status

Implemented.

## Shipped

- Added shared renderer-side custom store source helpers in
  `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/custom-store-source.ts`.
  - Normalizes source input, shared add/update/remove/toggle flows, and
    built-in/custom source merge behavior.
  - Adapts the shared source shape into Skill, MCP, and Plugin store source
    records instead of duplicating store-specific CRUD logic.
- Gated Skill custom-source deletion behind an in-app confirmation dialog.
  - `SkillStore` now requests deletion first, then removes the source only
    after explicit confirmation.
  - `SkillStoreCustomSources` no longer performs immediate destructive
    deletion from the sidebar row action.
- Added shared type-option support to `SkillStoreSourceEditModal` so MCP and
  Plugin stores can reuse the same edit surface without forking the modal.
- Added MCP custom store source state, persistence, and sidebar/store flow.
  - `mcp.store.ts` now persists `customStoreSources` and
    `selectedMarketSourceId`.
  - Built-in MCP market sources merge with enabled custom sources through the
    shared adapter.
  - MCP Store source loading skips remote reload for the built-in official
    source and treats custom sources as first-class channel entries.
  - A later security hardening moved MCP network authorization into the
    main-process source registry. Renderer persistence remains a compatibility
    mirror, reconciles additively at startup, and commits mutations only after
    the main-process registry accepts them.
- Added Plugin custom store source state, persistence, and source override
  flow.
  - `plugin.store.ts` now persists custom sources and selected source id.
  - Plugin renderer requests can pass the current merged source list into
    preview/install IPC calls, so custom marketplace entries resolve against
    the same source list shown in UI.
  - `CorePluginLibraryService` now accepts optional source overrides for list,
    preview, and install operations instead of assuming only built-in sources.
- Unified store naming around the PromptHub-maintained built-in channel.
  - MCP and Plugin sidebars now display `Official Store` /
    `官方商店` for the PromptHub-maintained built-in source while keeping
    underlying provenance and source metadata intact.
  - Sidebar source lists for MCP and Plugin now include a dedicated
    `添加商店` / `Add store` entry that routes users into the shared custom
    source creation flow.
- Resolved GitHub #167 by exposing the existing store-local search control for
  selected custom Skill Store sources.
  - Marketplace JSON, Git repository, and local-directory sources reuse
    `storeSearchQuery` and `filterRegistrySkills` against their loaded catalog.
  - Searching keeps the selected source unchanged and does not add a custom
    remote query contract.
- Corrected source-scoped Skill Store search state.
  - Switching store sources atomically clears the prior query and selected
    registry detail so hidden source-specific filters cannot leak across stores.
  - A loaded non-empty custom catalog with zero filtered matches now shows the
    standard search-empty guidance, while the custom-source remediation remains
    reserved for a genuinely empty loaded catalog.
