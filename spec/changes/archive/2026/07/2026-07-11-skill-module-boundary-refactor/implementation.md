# Implementation

## Status

The safety, renderer store, settings, and detail-page decomposition phases are
implemented and verified. The final root release gate passed and the change
shipped in `0.5.9`.

| ------------------------- | ----: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `skill.store.ts`          | 3,066 | registry, source updates, CRUD, scan, distribution, translation, and persistence composition |
| `skill.store.test.ts`     | 4,726 | unrelated store domains share one suite                                                      |
| `skill-installer.ts`      | 2,073 | facade still owns remote update safety policy                                                |
| `SkillFullDetailPage.tsx` | 2,895 | page composition, workflows, sections, and dialogs                                           |
| `settings.store.ts`       | 3,408 | all settings domains and migrations                                                          |
| `SkillSettings.tsx`       | 1,673 | close to the preferred 1,500-line ceiling                                                    |

The refactor treats these as architecture debt, not a line-moving exercise. New modules target one responsibility and explicit dependencies.

## Implemented Boundaries

- Main remote package safety policy moved into `skill-update-safety.ts`; `skill-installer.ts` is now 1,960 lines and below the hard limit.
- Skill detail source-update state and user actions moved into `useSkillSourceUpdate.ts`; the findings dialog moved into `SkillUpdateSafetyReviewDialog.tsx`.
- Exact-source trust/retry decision logic moved into the renderer service `skill-source-update-review.ts` with a focused three-case regression suite.
- Skill translation cache and persisted scan sanitization moved into focused
  renderer services. `skill.store.ts` is now a 41-line Zustand persistence
  composition root; typed library, scan, registry, translation, source-update
  workflow, persistence, and pure-domain modules own the extracted behavior.
- Store slices receive typed `set` and `get` dependencies and do not import the Zustand singleton. Persisted state remains centralized under the existing `skill-store` key, with the existing projection, sanitization, and hydration normalization preserved.
- `settings.store.ts` is now a 272-line persistence composition root. Typed
  action, normalization, default, appearance, AI, sync, and persistence
  modules retain the existing settings key and migration boundary.
- Skill safety settings moved into its own component; `SkillSettings.tsx` is
  1,495 lines and remains below the preferred 1,500-line ceiling.
- `SkillFullDetailPage.tsx` now composes header, tab, content/file,
  distribution, and modal boundaries and is 1,469 lines.
- `pnpm lint:file-size` now rejects new files above 2,000 lines and prevents every recorded legacy over-limit file from growing beyond its one-way baseline.

## Completed Migration Results

1. `settings.store.ts` now delegates serializable domain actions and
   normalization while preserving centralized persistence migration.
2. `SkillFullDetailPage.tsx` now delegates header/actions, tabs,
   content/files, distribution, and modal presentation sections.
3. Remaining legacy baseline entries are tracked by the project-wide
   hardening change; this change does not expand any over-limit file.

## Verification

- `pnpm lint:file-size`: passed.
- Desktop TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused source update, IPC, settings, store, and detail suites: 121 tests passed.
- Extracted project-settings and translation-cache suites: 4 tests passed.
- Main fingerprint approval and non-overridable blocked selection: 2 tests passed.
- Focused ESLint: passed.
- Desktop production build: passed.
- Decomposed Skill store state/cache/package/source/rollback suites: 79 tests passed.
- Source reconciliation, review, update policy, and translation-cache service suites: 35 tests passed.
- Final Skill store module sizes: root 41 lines; largest extracted module 918 lines.
- Final settings/detail composition sizes: settings root 272 lines,
  `SkillSettings.tsx` 1,495 lines, and `SkillFullDetailPage.tsx` 1,469 lines.
- The final root release harness passed all 22 checks in 333.9 seconds,
  including the source-size gate and desktop production bundle budget.
