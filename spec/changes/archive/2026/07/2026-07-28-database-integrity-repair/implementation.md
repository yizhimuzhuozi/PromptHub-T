# Implementation

## Status

Implemented and verified locally; not yet submitted or released.

## Implemented Behavior

- Database initialization now runs a lease-bound quick check before migration or
  application writes.
- Verified freelist-count mismatches create a timestamped integrity backup,
  repair through SQLite `VACUUM`, and require a fresh successful quick check.
- Integrity probes and repair connections use the same bounded busy timeout as
  normal initialization, so a concurrent writer is waited on rather than
  misreported as an immediate startup failure.
- Other corruption diagnostics stop initialization without guessed repair.
- Desktop Skill package IPC startup recovers every previous-process journal and
  pending row; runtime cleanup retains its age lease.
- Lifecycle compensation failures retain the stable renderer error contract and
  now record the underlying error stack in main-process logs.

## Verification

- Targeted database, lifecycle, IPC, remote package, skills.sh parser, store
  install, and renderer operation suites: 8 files, 148 tests passed.
- `pnpm --filter @prompthub/db typecheck`: passed.
- `pnpm --filter @prompthub/cli test -- database-concurrency.test.ts`: passed
  after reproducing the release-harness failure with a real overlapping writer.
- `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop lint`: passed.
- `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop typecheck`: passed.
- `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop build`: passed with existing bundle-size
  warnings only.
- A snapshot of the affected user database retained identical Skill, Prompt,
  and Skill-version row counts after `VACUUM`, and its quick check changed from
  the reproduced freelist mismatch to `ok`.
- An isolated live-network regression cloned
  `vercel-labs/agent-skills`, selected `vercel-react-best-practices`, completed
  the real package lifecycle against a real SQLite database, verified the
  installed `SKILL.md`, and retained `PRAGMA quick_check = ok`.
- Starting the current Desktop build against the affected user database removed
  the interrupted pending Skill row and lifecycle journal before accepting new
  package operations; the database remained healthy with 94 Skills, 126
  Prompts, and 505 Skill versions.
