# Implementation

## Shipped

- Added a verification acceptance delta spec with explicit requirements for direct usability, UI operation, reuse audit, unit/white-box coverage, static scan, safeguards, rollback, and performance.
- Updated stable verification and rule documents so future non-trivial changes have one acceptance matrix instead of scattered expectations.
- Applied the new acceptance matrix to the current desktop work in progress once, covering targeted unit/integration tests, static scans, browser smoke operation, and actual Electron window inspection.

## Verification

- `git diff --check` passed.
- `rg -n "TODO|待确认|pending|TBD|FIXME|占位" spec/changes/archive/2026/07/2026-07-06-verification-acceptance-hardening spec/workflow/04-verification/README.md spec/rules/testing-standards.md spec/rules/definition-of-done.md spec/rules/code-quality-architecture.md` completed; matches are intentional examples of scan targets, not unresolved placeholders.
- `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop typecheck` passed.
- Targeted desktop regression suite passed: **16 files / 210 tests**.
  - Prompt filtering, virtualized large prompt list, relationship panel, relationship graph, prompt relation DB, Skill store update/source/status/card/custom source behavior, Plugin manager, MCP manager, Plugin/MCP stores, network settings, and network proxy settings were included.
- Focused Plugin manager regression passed for opening an installed Plugin detail page and copying the local Plugin path.
- Static clipboard reuse scan:
  - `rg -n "navigator\.clipboard\.writeText|clipboard\.writeText" apps/desktop/src/renderer apps/web/src/client packages --glob '*.{ts,tsx}'`
  - Result: only the shared desktop clipboard utility remains as the allowed direct clipboard boundary.
- Static placeholder / unsafe-render scan:
  - `rg -n "dangerouslySetInnerHTML|@ts-ignore|toMatchSnapshot\(|TODO|FIXME" apps/desktop/src/renderer apps/web/src/client packages spec/changes/archive/2026/07/2026-07-06-verification-acceptance-hardening spec/workflow/04-verification spec/rules --glob '*.{ts,tsx,md}'`
  - Result: no new production unsafe-render or ignored-TypeScript pattern found in the touched implementation path; documentation matches are intentional examples of scan targets.
- Browser smoke verification ran against `http://localhost:5173/`:
  - Prompts page loaded with sidebar, search, relationship graph entry, and sort controls.
  - Relationship Graph opened and rendered the empty graph state in browser mode.
  - Settings -> Network Settings opened and showed Network Proxy plus Mirror Source controls.
  - Plugin page in plain browser mode hit `window.api.plugin` bridge absence, so browser-only Plugin verification is not accepted as a desktop Plugin runtime substitute.
- Actual Electron window inspection was performed after the Vite/Electron dev app started:
  - Prompt list loaded real local data with 126 prompts.
  - Sidebar Relationship Graph count displayed 126.
  - Prompt rows displayed parent/child indicators such as `子项 3`, `子项 1`, and parent markers.
  - Prompt detail displayed the relation entry button and relation count.
  - No destructive prompt, Skill, Plugin, or MCP actions were performed during manual inspection.

## Follow-ups

- Backfill more concrete UI/manual verification and missing unit tests for older desktop changes in their owning active changes.
- Clean up existing `PluginManager` React `act(...)` warnings. The current tests pass, but the warnings reduce signal quality and should be handled as test-quality debt.
- Add an Electron-aware automated UI harness for Plugin/MCP/Skill pages. Plain browser Playwright is useful for renderer smoke checks, but Electron bridge APIs must be verified in an Electron runtime or a faithful bridge fixture.
- Add reusable verification templates or scripts only after the manual matrix proves stable in normal development.
