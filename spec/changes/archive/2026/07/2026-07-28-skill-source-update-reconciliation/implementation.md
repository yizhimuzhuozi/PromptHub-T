# Implementation

## Status

Implementation completed as of 2026-07-08 for the v1 scope. The implementation covers shared source update types, shared `B/L/R` reconciliation check construction, pure reconciliation classification, `skill-package-sha256-v1` package fingerprinting, content-url single-file snapshots, legacy baseline upgrade decisions, DB baseline columns, store update baseline writes, linked-local update blocking, source-unavailable error recording, project/agent copied target stale auxiliary reporting, renderer source resolver adapter classification, raw content-url package fingerprint normalization, staged remote package safety preflight, non-local remote source materialization before metadata baseline writes, managed repo staging/backup swap on partial copy failure, raw content-url pre-write safety scan and version rollback, SHA-256-labeled durable package fingerprint writes, and renderer UI messaging for blocked/baseline-missing/source-unavailable states.

The 2026-07-14 follow-up also removes unverified skills.sh directory guesses
and adds bounded recursive Git package discovery. Install, fingerprint, and
update-snapshot flows now carry the Skill selector when the physical directory
is unknown. A real installation smoke against `mattpocock/skills` located
`skills/productivity/grill-me`, validated the package, and materialized
`SKILL.md` plus its `agents` directory.

## Code Added

- `packages/shared/types/skill.ts`: added shared source update status, snapshot, stale target, and update check types.
- `packages/shared/utils/skill-source-update.ts`: added pure source update reconciliation helpers, shared `buildSkillSourceUpdateCheck()` snapshot builder for `B/L/R` classification, sync/async SHA-256 package fingerprinting, content-url snapshot helpers, legacy upgrade decision helper, and linked-local action policy.
- `packages/db/src/schema.ts`, `packages/db/src/init.ts`, `packages/db/src/skill.ts`: added and persisted source baseline columns for fresh installs and existing-user migrations.
- `packages/db/src/init.ts`: backfills existing non-empty `directory_fingerprint` rows with `fingerprint_algorithm = legacy-stable-text-v1` so upgraded users do not silently reinterpret old stable-text values as SHA-256 package fingerprints.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/skill-store-update.ts`: updated store checks to construct source snapshots and delegate status classification to the shared reconciliation builder while preserving legacy package-resource update detection.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/skill-source-resolver.ts`: added the source resolver adapter boundary for remote store, remote Git, remote zip, raw content URL, local-linked, and managed-copy source kinds; raw content URLs are normalized as single-file packages whose package fingerprint equals fetched content hash.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/stores/skill.store.ts`: writes source baseline fields during install/update/refresh, blocks linked local overwrite updates, records sanitized `source_last_error` for source check failures, materializes non-local remote source updates before metadata/baseline writes, passes optional AI safety scan config to remote package materialization, safety-scans raw content-url updates before writing, rolls back raw content-url writes on final DB failure, derives ClawHub package/content URLs from installed page URLs when the store entry is absent, and attaches project/agent copied target stale reports to source checks through `hasStaleTargets` / `staleTargets`.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer.ts` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/github-skill-store.ts`: tree/API registry scans no longer derive `directory_fingerprint` from Git blob hashes; those paths leave the package fingerprint empty until a clone/materialized package can be hashed with `skill-package-sha256-v1`.
- `packages/shared/utils/skill-identity.ts`: confirmed as the centralized ignore/fingerprint predicate used by desktop main, renderer, and CLI paths; it ignores local env/runtime/cache output while preserving distributable templates such as `.env.example`.
- `packages/core/src/cli/skill-cli-service.ts`: records `fingerprint_algorithm` for CLI package fingerprint writes, records installed baseline fields for source-backed CLI installs, and computes durable package fingerprints with the shared SHA-256 v1 package manifest utility.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-repo-sync.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/skill/local-repo-handlers.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/skill/version-handlers.ts`, and `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer.ts`: record `fingerprint_algorithm` when main-process DB writes refresh package fingerprints and compute durable package fingerprints with the shared SHA-256 v1 package manifest utility.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-safety-scan.ts`: added deterministic preflight scanning reusable without AI configuration.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer.ts`: runs staged remote git/zip package preflight before copying into the managed repo; blocking findings leave the previous repo intact.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer-discovery.ts`: discovers
  nested Git packages by exact normalized Skill identity with depth/directory
  limits, shared ignore rules, and no remote symlink traversal.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/skills-sh-store.ts`: preserves repository
  and Skill identity without fabricating a physical package directory.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer-repo.ts`: `saveToLocalRepoBySkillId()` now copies into a staging directory and swaps with a backup so partial copy or sidecar write failures preserve the previous managed repo.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/skill/local-repo-handlers.ts` and `apps/desktop/src/preload/api/skill.ts`: allow optional staged package safety scan config for remote package saves.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/skill/SkillFullDetailPage.tsx` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/skill/SkillStoreDetail.tsx`: added user guidance for baseline-missing/source-unavailable/no-source and linked-local blocked updates.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/services/skill-source-update-reconciliation.test.ts`: added TDD coverage for the core status matrix, stale target auxiliary reporting, legacy upgrade decisions, linked-local blocking, SHA-256 package fingerprinting, and raw content-url snapshots.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/services/skill-source-resolver.test.ts`: added adapter classification coverage for remote zip, remote Git, raw content URL, local-linked, and managed-copy sources, plus the raw content-url stale directory fingerprint regression.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/services/github-skill-store.test.ts` and `apps/desktop/tests/unit/main/skill-installer.test.ts`: added regressions proving GitHub/Gitea tree/API scans do not expose legacy blob-hash manifests as package fingerprints.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/main/skill-source-update-db.test.ts`: added DB schema/migration/persistence coverage for source baseline fields.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/main/skill-installer-remote-git-package.test.ts`: added staged remote zip safety preflight rollback coverage and partial copy failure rollback coverage for managed repo replacement.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/stores/skill.store.test.ts`: added package baseline install/update/refresh, source-unavailable sanitized error recording, remote package and content-url update failure ordering, materialized content-url rollback on final DB failure, raw content-url safety-scan blocking before write, project/agent stale copied target auxiliary reporting, full source status integration matrix coverage, proof that source updates do not mutate copied project/agent scan snapshots, raw content-url single-file fingerprint normalization, and linked-local blocked update coverage.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/clawhub-store.ts`: added shared ClawHub page URL parsing and API URL derivation helpers so installed ClawHub page sources can resolve to package zip updates without Git clone.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/i18n/locales/*.json`: added localized keys for baseline-missing, source-unavailable, no-source, and linked-local blocked update guidance.
- `spec/knowledge/behavior/skills.md`: synced stable source update reconciliation rules for package baselines, status boundaries, linked-local protection, remote package apply ordering, raw content-url safety/rollback, and sanitized source errors.
- `spec/knowledge/reference/skill-regression-test-matrix.md`: added required regression rows for remote package update failure ordering, source-unavailable sanitized errors, downstream stale reporting, content-url durability, raw content-url fingerprint normalization, and SHA-256-labeled durable fingerprint writes.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/components/skill-full-detail-async-actions.test.tsx` and `apps/desktop/tests/unit/components/skill-store-remote.test.tsx`: added linked-local guidance UI coverage and source update status action coverage for `up-to-date`, `update-available`, `conflict`, `baseline-missing`, `source-unavailable`, and `no-source`.

## 2026-07-13 Proxy Compatibility Follow-up

- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer-remote.ts`: remote text and
  package-byte fetches now detect a configured request proxy before DNS
  validation. Proxy-generated RFC 2544 `198.18/15` compatibility answers are
  allowed for arbitrary public source hostnames, and the original hostname is
  passed to the proxy agent instead of the synthetic address. Real private
  addresses and direct requests retain the existing SSRF block.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/main/skill-installer-remote.test.ts`: added install
  and update regressions for proxy compatibility DNS answers, original-host
  routing, binary package fetches, and real private-address rejection.

## 2026-07-13 Source Diagnostics Follow-up

- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/skill-source-resolver.ts`: source
  diagnostics now resolve the adapter kind and a safe display reference for
  local directories, managed copies, Git, ZIP, content URL, and store sources;
  local metadata is preferred when old entries mix local and remote fields.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/skill-store-update.ts` and
  `apps/desktop/src/renderer/stores/skill/skill-source-update-workflow.ts`:
  `source-unavailable` checks now carry `sourceKind`, `sourceReference`, and a
  sanitized `sourceError` while preserving the existing durable
  `source_last_error` field.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/skill/skill-source-update-diagnostics.ts`,
  `SkillStoreDetail.tsx`, and `useSkillSourceUpdate.ts`: update feedback now
  identifies source type, path/address, and failure reason; source failures are
  shown as errors rather than generic informational toasts.
- Added resolver, local-source store, remote-source store, and detail toast
  regressions. Focused source tests (30 tests) and full-detail async action
  tests (22 tests) pass; desktop typecheck and Prettier checks pass.

## 2026-07-13 Agent Local Source Follow-up

- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/stores/skill/skill-library-actions.ts`: copied
  Agent imports now use an external symlink's concrete target for `source_url`
  and `source_id`; the Agent shortcut remains the local distribution path so
  rescan and uninstall behavior are unchanged.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-package-validation.ts` and
  `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer-repo.ts`: local package
  validation, walking, and copying now apply the same shared ignore predicate
  as package fingerprints. `node_modules`, caches, runtime output, and local
  environment files therefore cannot make a valid Agent source fail package
  limits or pollute the managed copy.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/skill/SkillFullDetailPage.tsx` and
  `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/skill/SkillDetailHeader.tsx`: managed
  non-builtin Agent details expose source check/update actions while retaining
  the restricted Agent management action set.
- Added regressions for ignored dependency files, ignored dependency copying,
  external symlink source binding, and Agent detail source actions.

## 2026-07-14 Private Gitea Transport Follow-up

- Git-backed registry sources now resolve a canonical repository, branch, and
  package directory from GitHub/Gitea repository, tree, source, and raw URLs.
- Source checks no longer fetch Git-backed `content_url` values through the
  generic HTTP IPC. A typed main/preload IPC clones and validates the repository
  once, then returns `SKILL.md` content and the complete v1 package fingerprint
  from the same snapshot.
- Package install and legacy remote update paths share the same canonical Git
  descriptor. Local directory adapters still read local files, ClawHub remains
  on its package API, and raw content URLs retain the generic SSRF-protected
  fetch path.
- Added a private-network Gitea regression that forces the generic HTTP path to
  throw the reported internal-address error and proves the check succeeds via
  Git without calling that path. Added resolver, IPC validation, one-clone
  snapshot, install, update, and failure-path coverage.
- Authenticated Gitea clone URLs remain intact for Git transport, while review
  identities, Git process diagnostics, ZIP/Git safety inputs, and AI safety
  prompts use credential-free canonical URLs.
- Fixed the shared Git and ZIP wrappers to await snapshot reads, package
  fingerprinting, safety review, and persistence before deleting temporary
  staging directories; deferred snapshot and real ZIP tests cover the cleanup
  ordering.

Verification for this follow-up:

- The focused private-Gitea/source-routing suite passed with 7 test files and
  100 tests. The regression reproduces the reported internal-address HTTP
  failure and proves the Git snapshot path succeeds without invoking generic
  HTTP.
- The complete desktop unit suite passed with 354 test files and 3,123 tests
  after the transport audit and credential-boundary regressions were added.
- Desktop production build, shared/desktop type checks, root lint, file-size
  lint, Prettier, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Self-hosted web lint, type check, tests, client/server production builds, and
  Cloudflare worker lint, type check, and tests passed. The release quick-profile
  checks were covered across the final reruns after stale raw-HTTP test
  expectations were updated to the canonical Git snapshot contract.

## 2026-07-14 Source Transport Audit Follow-up

- Legacy Gitea/GitHub raw, file, tree, and source URLs now recover canonical
  repository, decoded branch, and package-directory metadata even when old
  rows no longer retain a separate repository URL.
- Installed Skills with a concrete external local source now keep that path as
  the source of truth even when a remote catalog entry reuses their source id.
- Added a shared validated package snapshot reader. Local, Git, and ZIP
  adapters now derive `SKILL.md` plus the v1 fingerprint from the same file
  inventory; ZIP checks inspect extracted package bytes instead of cached
  registry content.
- Added real-filesystem snapshot, main IPC validation, hosted-Git recovery,
  local/catalog collision, standalone Gitea fingerprint, and ZIP routing
  regressions.

## 2026-07-14 Multi-Skill Lifecycle Selector Audit

- `SkillPackageOperationSource.remote-git` now carries a validated optional
  `skillName` selector. The same selector is forwarded through operation
  validation, source identity, main-process staging, package discovery,
  materialization, fingerprint snapshots, install, check, and update.
- Fallback operation and source identities now include the selector, so two
  Skills from the same repository cannot collide when legacy catalog metadata
  lacks a stable source id or explicit directory.
- Repository discovery now uses Unicode-safe identity normalization, searches
  hidden Agent Skill containers such as `.agents/skills` and
  `.cursor/skills`, skips VCS/generated directories without blanket-rejecting
  hidden Agent roots, and never follows repository symlinks.
- Exact parsed frontmatter identity takes precedence over folder-name fallback.
  Standard `skills` and `data/skills` containers outrank hidden Agent
  containers, which outrank generic repository examples. Multiple candidates
  at the same priority fail with an explicit ambiguity error instead of
  selecting an arbitrary package.
- Added regressions for explicit selector forwarding, display-name mismatch,
  single-package selector mismatch, same-repository identity separation,
  standard-container precedence, hidden Agent containers, Unicode names,
  invalid selectors, and unresolved ambiguity.

## 2026-07-13 Real Dev-Window Verification

- Started the desktop development environment with `pnpm --dir apps/desktop dev`; Vite served `http://localhost:5173/` and the Electron window loaded the renderer.
- Exercised the live user flow: `Skills` -> `Agent Skill` -> `Codex CLI` -> `opencode-cli` -> `在我的 Skill 中打开`.
- Clicked `检查来源更新` for the imported local Agent Skill. The UI displayed `已是最新` and retained the concrete local source `/Users/lingxiaotian/.codex/skills/opencode-cli`; it did not report the generic `来源暂时不可用` error.
- The development terminal also reported the expected cloud store feed network-unavailable diagnostic in this offline environment; it did not affect local source resolution or the successful local check.

## 2026-07-14 Review-First Skill Detail Update

- Installed Skill details now expose one stable source action: check for
  updates. The header no longer morphs into an update action or adds an
  overwrite-local button after reconciliation.
- Actionable reconciliation results retain the structured local and remote
  content in renderer state and open the shared Skill update review dialog.
  The dialog identifies local and source versions, renders the `SKILL.md`
  line diff, and offers explicit keep-local and use-source decisions.
- Keeping local or closing the dialog only clears transient review state.
  Using the source version enters the existing rollback-aware update workflow;
  explicit overwrite authorization is limited to `local-modified`, `conflict`,
  and `baseline-missing`.
- Existing package safety review, linked-local protection, staging, snapshots,
  rollback, and baseline persistence remain unchanged and are exercised after
  the version decision rather than bypassed by the header.
- The comparison now enters with a restrained backdrop fade and panel
  fade/zoom/slide using the shared motion duration and easing tokens. Existing
  OS and in-app reduced-motion overrides remain effective.
- Component regressions passed for the one-action header, all actionable
  reconciliation states, non-mutating keep-local behavior, source acceptance,
  high-risk continuation, and linked-local blocking. Related Skill detail and
  remote-catalog suites passed with 49 tests; desktop type checking and focused
  lint passed. The development window confirmed that a current Skill retains
  one check action and an up-to-date result does not open a misleading dialog.

## 2026-07-14 Complete Package Difference Review

- `SkillPackageSnapshot` now carries the validated package scope and a bounded,
  sorted file inventory with path, size, SHA-256 digest, text/binary kind, and
  safe preview content. Main-process snapshots derive this inventory from the
  same buffers used by package validation and fingerprinting.
- Local, Git, ZIP, store, and Cloud source checks preserve both local and source
  package snapshots through the renderer workflow. Raw content URLs construct
  an explicit single-file snapshot and therefore do not claim unrelated local
  auxiliary files will be removed.
- The update review now lists every effective added, modified, and removed
  package file. Selecting a text file renders its own line diff; binary and
  oversized text files remain visible with complete size/hash comparison
  semantics rather than unsafe decoding or silent omission.
- Focused snapshot, package-diff, source-routing, and component suites passed
  with 33 tests. Desktop lint, typecheck, and production build passed. A live
  Electron check on `image-to-video` opened the wider package review, showed
  the exact one-file change for that source, and keeping the local version
  closed the dialog without applying an update.

## 2026-07-14 Shared-Repository Identity Correction

- The apparent `image-to-video` update was a false sibling comparison: its
  stale source id missed the current catalog entry, then repository-only
  fallback selected the first sibling, `video-edit`.
- Installed-source recovery now tries exact source id, content URL, and registry
  slug before repository fallback. A repository shared by multiple Skills must
  produce one unique directory/path/name match; ties no longer select the first
  entry.
- Successful up-to-date reconciliation repairs non-empty canonical source
  metadata through the existing update transaction. The skills.sh parser now
  rejects display-truncated repository labels such as `r…t-skills` and uses the
  canonical detail-path repository instead.
- Remote Git snapshots now return the validated repository-relative Skill
  directory. Reconciliation persists that discovered directory and canonical
  `SKILL.md` path, replacing legacy guessed paths such as
  `skills/image-to-video` when the repository actually uses `image-to-video`.
- The review header now shows the Skill identity only. The duplicate
  local/source version cards were removed because catalog version labels did
  not help decide between package contents.
- The public `agentspace-so/runcomfy-agent-skills` tree was inspected directly:
  `image-to-video` is a valid single-file package containing only
  `image-to-video/SKILL.md`. The earlier `Video Edit` diff was therefore a
  sibling-selection defect, not omitted auxiliary files.
- Verification: the seven focused snapshot, package-diff, source-routing,
  skills.sh parser, locale, and component suites passed with 72 tests; the
  nested Git-package lifecycle suite passed with 16 tests. Desktop lint,
  typecheck, production build, formatting, and `git diff --check` passed.

## Current Findings

- Current Skill update detection already has the statuses `not-installed`, `up-to-date`, `update-available`, `local-modified`, and `conflict`.
- Current DB stores `directory_fingerprint` as the current local package fingerprint and `installed_content_hash` as entry content baseline.
- DB now stores `installed_directory_fingerprint`, `fingerprint_algorithm`, `source_last_checked_at`, `source_last_error`, and `source_binding_state`.
- Current `computeStableTextHash` is deterministic but not SHA-256. It remains a legacy identity helper for source ids, compatibility tests, and old-row comparison; durable package baselines labeled `skill-package-sha256-v1` use the shared v1 package manifest utility.
- Current ignore predicate already excludes `.env` and `.env.*` while preserving `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, and `.env.template`.

## Verification So Far

- 2026-07-14 multi-Skill lifecycle selector audit: focused desktop/core suites
  passed with 98 tests; shared/core/desktop type checks, root lint, Prettier,
  `git diff --check`, and the desktop production build passed. The complete
  desktop suite passed with 359 files and 3,170 tests before the final strict
  single-package mismatch guard; that final delta is included in the 98 focused
  passing tests.
- A live Git snapshot against
  `https://github.com/mattpocock/skills` resolved selector `grill-me` to
  `skills/productivity/grill-me`, returned the expected `SKILL.md`, and
  produced a valid 64-character package SHA-256 fingerprint.
- The latest `pnpm verify:release:quick` run passed CLI, shared/core/desktop
  checks and the complete desktop build, then encountered one unrelated Web
  import/export test timeout under full-suite contention. That exact Web file
  passed immediately in isolation with 2 tests in 5.58 seconds; the harness is
  therefore recorded as incomplete rather than falsely reported as green.
- 2026-07-14 skills.sh nested-package follow-up: 59 focused parser, IPC,
  store-routing, recursive-discovery, and remote-package tests passed. A real
  `mattpocock/skills` clone resolved `grill-me` to
  `skills/productivity/grill-me` and materialized `SKILL.md` plus `agents`;
  the update snapshot selector is covered with the same repository layout.
- 2026-07-14 final release harness desktop suite passed with 365 files and
  3,195 tests.
- 2026-07-14 `pnpm verify:release:quick` passed all 18 desktop, CLI,
  self-hosted web, and Cloudflare worker gates in 405.4 seconds after the final
  selector-aware snapshot change.
- 2026-07-14 source transport and credential follow-up: focused source,
  lifecycle, filesystem, safety, and store suite passed with 16 files and 276
  tests.
- 2026-07-14 complete desktop unit suite passed with 354 files and 3,123 tests.
- 2026-07-14 root lint (including file-size policy), shared/desktop type checks,
  desktop production build, Prettier, and `git diff --check` passed.

- Static audits with `rg` for direct `directory_fingerprint` / `installed_directory_fingerprint` writes, legacy hash utility use, source update UI labels, and source fetch/clone paths.
- `pnpm verify:release:quick` passed in 329.7s after the repo-copy staging expectation was updated in the legacy installer regression test.
- `pnpm verify:release:quick` passed in 500.2s after the review follow-up fixes for tree/API fingerprints, legacy fingerprint algorithm migration, content-url baselines, and source error URL credential redaction.
- `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop typecheck`
- `git diff --check`
- Manual regression probe: `git ls-remote https://clawhub.ai/mineru-extract/mineru-document-extractor HEAD` still fails because the page URL redirects, while ClawHub `SKILL.md` and package zip API endpoints for `mineru-document-extractor` return HTTP 200; the updated source resolver now uses the package zip endpoint for ClawHub updates.

## Remaining Future Work

- A dedicated DB-backed source update service can still centralize renderer orchestration later, but v1 behavior now uses the shared reconciliation builder and persists the required baseline/error fields.
- UI presentation for project/agent downstream stale copy targets can be improved later; v1 intentionally exposes them as auxiliary `SkillSourceUpdateCheck` fields rather than as a source status.

## Review Decisions Applied

- v1 uses `skill-package-sha256-v1` for durable package fingerprints.
- Existing rows with missing `installed_directory_fingerprint` are silently upgraded only when legacy entry hashes prove local and remote match.
- A single `fingerprint_algorithm` field applies to both current and installed package fingerprints.
- `downstream-stale` is removed from `SkillSourceUpdateStatus` and exposed through distribution scan data or auxiliary `SkillSourceUpdateCheck` fields.
- `source-moved` is deferred from v1.
- Remote updates cannot directly overwrite `local-linked` external folders in v1.
- Raw `content-url` sources are treated as single-file packages.
- Safety scan runs after staging materialization and before atomic replace.

## Stable Docs To Sync After Implementation

- `spec/knowledge/behavior/skills.md` synced for v1 source update behavior.
- `spec/knowledge/reference/skill-regression-test-matrix.md` synced for v1 regression coverage.
- `spec/knowledge/structure/skill-system-design.md` synced for resolver and package fingerprint boundaries.
