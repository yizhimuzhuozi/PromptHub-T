# Implementation

## Status

Completed and converged. The feature is present on the current main branch;
GitHub issue/release state is tracked separately from this local change record.

## Changes

- Ported the useful Prompt output-format contribution from `jazzson51569/PromptHub` commit `fa7b0e6b`.
- Added `prompt_output_format_items` with cascade cleanup.
- Added `PromptOutputFormatDB` and desktop IPC/preload/store wiring.
- Added a Prompt detail panel for configuring output sequences.
- Updated copy behavior so configured sequences are copied as one combined clipboard text.
- Added seven-locale i18n keys and DB regression tests.
- Added backup/export/import support for output format items, including import-shape validation, orphan filtering, preview counts, and selective Prompt export inclusion.
- Added a partial unique index for source self-reference rows so SQLite enforces the one-self-item invariant even outside the app service path.

## Verification

- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop test -- tests/unit/main/prompt-output-format-db.test.ts tests/unit/components/prompt-detail-metadata.test.tsx --run`
- `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop test -- tests/unit/main/prompt-output-format-db.test.ts tests/unit/services/database-backup-format.test.ts tests/unit/services/database-backup.test.ts --run`
- `git diff --check`

## Notes

The fork branch was not merged directly because it has unrelated build, debug, package, and local data-path changes. This change intentionally ports only the output-format/Prompt-copy feature.
