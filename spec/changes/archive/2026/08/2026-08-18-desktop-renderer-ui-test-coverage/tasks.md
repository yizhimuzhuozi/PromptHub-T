      symlink rejection for directory candidates, standalone backup files, and
      restore sources
- [x] `tests/unit/components/mcp-batch-deploy-dialog.test.tsx` and
      `tests/unit/stores/mcp.store.test.ts` follow-up MCP delete-state,
      disabled-target, selection, non-submit, decorative-media, and duplicate
      batch deploy click regressions
- [x] `tests/unit/components/plugin-agent-target-picker.test.tsx` and
      `tests/unit/stores/plugin.store.test.ts` follow-up Plugin delete-cache,
      Agent target distribution, copy/symlink mode, non-submit,

      regressions

## Verification

- [x] `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop test -- --run` passes (0 failures)
- [x] `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop lint` passes
- [x] File-level component test count ≥ 65 (current 102, target ≥65)
- [x] Renderer title-backed button scan reports 0 buttons with `title` and no
      explicit `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby`
- [x] Renderer non-semantic clickable scan reports 0 `div` / `span` / `li` /
      `tr` / `section` / `article` elements with `onClick` and no explicit
      `role`
- [x] Renderer button-contained icon scan reports 0 icon components / `svg`
      elements inside buttons without explicit accessibility treatment
- [x] Renderer native input / textarea accessible-name hint scan reduced the
      current candidate set from 94 to 89 after targeted textbox fixes
- [x] Renderer native input / textarea accessible-name hint scan reduced the
      current candidate set from 9 to 7 after binding the appearance wallpaper
      adjustment slider labels
- [x] Renderer native input / textarea accessible-name hint scan reduced the
      current candidate set from 7 to 5 after binding skill copied-distribution
      delete checkbox names and descriptions
- [x] Renderer native input / textarea accessible-name hint scan reduced the
      current candidate set from 5 to 0 after giving hidden image, `.md`, and
      icon upload file inputs explicit accessible names
- [x] Renderer dialog role scan reports 0 `dialog` / `alertdialog` elements
      without `aria-modal`
- [x] Renderer custom Input / Textarea accessible-name hint scan reduced the
      current 40-line candidate set from 8 to 7 after the edit prompt AI
      rewrite textbox fix; tag manager fixes were verified by role/name tests
      because those inputs already had placeholder fallbacks and did not appear
      in the 40-line scan
- [x] Renderer custom Input / Textarea accessible-name hint scan reduced the
      current 40-line candidate set from 7 to 3 after project path, scan path,
      personal notes, and snapshot note textbox fixes
- [x] Renderer custom Input / Textarea accessible-name hint scan reduced the
      current 40-line candidate set from 3 to 2 after the platform workbench
      search fix, and a structured follow-up scan reports 0 actual custom
      Input / Textarea calls without a label / id / aria name / placeholder
- [x] AI test response Markdown links use the same safe protocol filtering as
      prompt Markdown and downgrade unsafe protocols to text
- [x] AI test generated-image downloads reuse the shared generated-image
      download helper so remote blobs, temporary anchors, and object URLs are
      cleaned up on click failure
- [x] Appearance settings background-image selection reports save failures
      instead of silently clearing the loading state
- [x] About settings web update checks report network / malformed release
      lookup / unknown current-version failures instead of silently returning
      to idle or latest
- [x] Skill code pane local source card uses a keyboard-accessible button
      instead of an anchor without `href`
- [x] Skill code pane local source open failures report a user-visible toast
      instead of failing silently
- [x] Update dialog release-note Markdown links use the same safe protocol
      filtering as prompt Markdown and downgrade unsafe protocols to text
- [x] `pnpm verify:release:quick` release-harness closeout performed; the only
      rerun failure was the network-bound web Docker runtime deps integration
      test, and that test passed when rerun with registry/network access
- [x] Route legacy `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, and dynamic `toMatchSnapshot()` debt
      to `Q-006`; no new matches are allowed. The final scan still finds legacy
      matches in older main-process, service, store, and integration tests,
      while the release-harness `AISettingsPrototype` fix did not add new
      matches
- [x] Update `implementation.md` with the actual coverage delta and any tests
      we had to drop or rewrite during execution
