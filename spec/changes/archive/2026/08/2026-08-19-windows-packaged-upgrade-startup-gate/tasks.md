# Tasks

- [x] `T-WINSTART-001` (`FR-WINSTART-001`, `DES-WINSTART-001`,
      `TEST-WINSTART-001`): add failing Windows-handle regression tests and repair
      all in-scope read-only file flushes.
- [x] `T-WINSTART-002` (`FR-WINSTART-002`, `DES-WINSTART-002`,
      `TEST-WINSTART-002`): add the packaged Windows upgrade smoke and release
      workflow gate.
- [x] `T-WINSTART-003` (`NFR-WINSTART-001`, `DES-WINSTART-003`,
      `TEST-WINSTART-003`): verify bounded cleanup, run local release gates, push an
      isolated commit, and run the manual full release workflow.
- [x] `T-WINSTART-004` (`FR-WINSTART-002`, `DES-WINSTART-002`,
      `TEST-WINSTART-003`): update release records and keep publication blocked
      until all checks pass.
- [x] `T-WINSTART-005` (`FR-WINSTART-001`, `DES-WINSTART-001`,
      `TEST-WINSTART-005`): tolerate unsupported directory fsync after the
      desktop skill reconciliation marker has been atomically committed.
- [x] `T-WINSTART-006` (`NFR-WINSTART-001`, `DES-WINSTART-003`,
      `TEST-WINSTART-006`): wait for packaged-process close and retry bounded
      transient Windows cleanup failures without hiding persistent errors.
- [x] `T-WINSTART-007` (`FR-WINSTART-003`, `DES-WINSTART-004`,
      `TEST-WINSTART-007`): lock the existing-release workflow contract so a
      same-tag replacement preserves draft state and replaces assets with
      clobber semantics without automatic publication.
- [x] `T-WINSTART-008` (`FR-WINSTART-003`, `DES-WINSTART-004`,
      `TEST-WINSTART-007`): freeze and verify the current candidate, record the
      old remote tag/release inventory, push the replacement tag with an
      expected-old-value lease, verify the refreshed draft assets and platform
      evidence, then explicitly publish the prerelease.
