# Implementation

## Status

- Phase: converge
- Status: review-pending

## Shipped

- Extracted recursive file-tree rendering into `SkillFileTree` and kept file source, mutation, save, and unsaved-change orchestration in `SkillFileEditor`.
- Stabilized the modified-file path set so repeated keystrokes in the same file do not invalidate the memoized tree.
- Extracted Skill Store category/source metadata into a tested pure view-model module and memoized the existing catalog boundary.
- Extracted Markdown rendering into `SkillStoreDetailMarkdown`, preserving full and immersive translation behavior behind a memoized boundary.
- Reduced the three failing source files from 1,507 / 1,536 / 1,536 lines to 1,350 / 1,432 / 1,482 lines. New production modules are 290 / 128 / 90 lines.

## Verification

- `TEST-DSUP-001`:
  - Command: `pnpm lint:file-size`
  - Result: passed; no preferred, legacy, or hard-limit violations.
- `TEST-DSUP-002`, `TEST-DSUP-003`, `TEST-DSUP-004`:
  - Command: focused Vitest run covering 9 files / 69 tests across file editor, store source/catalog, detail Markdown/timers/install state, and Skill UI integration.
  - Result: 9 files / 69 tests passed.
  - Command: `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop typecheck`
  - Result: passed.
  - Command: `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop lint`
  - Result: passed with zero warnings.
  - Command: targeted `git diff --check`.
  - Result: passed.
  - Warnings: existing Skill UI integration tests still emit React `act(...)` warnings; assertions pass and this refactor did not introduce those test flows.
  - Skipped: visual operation was not required because the change preserves rendered copy, layout, and user workflows; behavior and interaction surfaces were exercised through existing integration tests.

## Analyze

- Traceability complete: yes.
- Conflicts/blockers resolved: the existing desktop performance change excludes these Skill component files; no data or contract boundary changes are required.

## Converge

- Stable workflow/knowledge/rules synced: `spec/knowledge/structure/desktop-frontend-performance.md` updated.
- Issues/releases/ADRs/indexes synced: change index regenerated; no issue, release, or ADR update required for this renderer-only refactor.
- Final change destination: remains active until verification and worktree separation are complete.

## Synced Docs

- `spec/knowledge/structure/desktop-frontend-performance.md`

## Follow-ups

- Web Agent management is intentionally separate because the web server's Agent root/config ownership must be inspected before choosing a contract.

## Lifecycle Disposition (2026-08-18)

Status: completed. Commit `578266c7` contains the implementation, no current
dirty file is owned by this change, and the stable performance document is
synchronized.
