# Image Generation Workbench UI Acceptance Matrix

## Selected Direction

The accepted visual reference is
[`assets/workbench-selected-direction-v4-simplified.png`](./assets/workbench-selected-direction-v4-simplified.png). It defines the
information architecture and relative visual hierarchy; production implementation must
reuse the current PromptHub tokens and components rather than rasterizing the mock.

## Navigation And Entry

| Case                          | Acceptance                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct entry                  | Prompts remains selected in the global rail; the Prompts secondary panel is hidden. |
| Existing Prompt entry         | Current Prompt ID/version, resolved content and references prefill a draft.         |
| Top Prompt type filters       | “全部 / 文本 / 绘图” remain Prompt list filters and do not select the workbench.    |
| Navigate away during a batch  | Generation continues; returning restores current counts and selected batch.         |
| Browser-style back navigation | Returning to Prompt view does not discard a submitted batch or mutate Prompt.       |

The Prompt store gains a distinct `generation` view mode rather than a new global app
module. Folder/tag selection is preserved but does not filter the workbench. Selecting a
folder, Prompt filter or relationship graph exits generation view explicitly.

The global 80 px module rail remains visible. The transient Prompts secondary panel and the
right settings/history panel are mutually exclusive: opening either closes the other without
changing the ordinary Prompt sidebar preference.

## Wide Layout

At widths `>= 1440px`:

- Existing global rail retains its width; Prompts secondary navigation is suppressed.
- The workbench replaces normal Prompt list/detail columns with one continuous surface.
- Current-batch results use one dominant `object-contain` preview and a fixed thumbnail
  strip. All/favorite/failed filters retain stable result-grid density modes.
- Generation settings and bounded history share an on-demand in-flow right panel. The panel is
  closed during ordinary review; when opened it reserves its own column and the review canvas
  reflows rather than being covered.
- Generation controls must not span the top of the result canvas.
- The bottom selection bar stays inside the result region and never covers the right
  panel.

## Compact Layout

The Desktop minimum remains `800x600`.

| Width          | Required behavior                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1100..1439px` | Review canvas reflows beside the in-flow right panel; no overlay.     |
| `800..1099px`  | Gallery and panel remain siblings; thumbnails scroll inside gallery.  |
| Any supported  | No overlap or horizontal page scrolling; only content regions scroll. |

At compact widths, model/ratio/quality/count controls keep stable hit targets inside the
panel. Secondary actions live in accessible menus; the primary generation action stays
visible whenever settings are open. Text does not scale with viewport width.

## Composer States

| State                         | Visible behavior                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No image model configured     | Model warning and Settings action; Generate is disabled with reason.             |
| Direct entry, no source       | Prompt selector and adhoc input are available; no Prompt is created implicitly.  |
| Prompt with variables         | Missing variables are identified inline; resolved preview updates before submit. |
| Unsupported model parameter   | Control is disabled/hidden from capability data; no silent request downgrade.    |
| Reference image limit reached | Additional selection is blocked with the model-specific maximum.                 |
| Count invalid                 | Only integer `1..100` is accepted; Generate remains disabled.                    |
| New draft count               | Defaults to one image and resets to one when a new batch is created.             |
| Valid submission              | Button press creates visible queued batch immediately and clears no source data. |

Source Prompt/version, model, execution Prompt, required variables, ratio/size, quality
and count remain visible together after opening the settings drawer. Count has a visible
field label inside the configuration flow rather than appearing as an unlabeled footer
stepper; the footer contains only the primary Generate action. Reference images live in an explicit
disclosure whose collapsed summary exposes the current count. Seed, style and provider-
specific allowlisted parameters remain secondary and appear only when supported.

Reference selection is always explicit: choosing a source Prompt does not silently add
its media. The disclosure supports the native file picker, file drop, Prompt-media
selection, removal and drag ordering. Each selected item identifies its source, and the
Prompt-media grid reveals thumbnails in bounded pages rather than mounting the complete
library at once.

## Batch And Result States

| State               | Result wall                                           | Right panel / actions                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Empty library       | Operational creation empty state, not marketing.      | Recent source suggestions only when real.                                 |
| New draft           | Current-batch view is empty; history is not rendered. | Settings remain visible and history is reachable from the inspector.      |
| Queued              | Stable slot placeholders.                             | Position/status and Cancel remaining.                                     |
| Running             | Completed images appear progressively.                | Accurate total counts and bounded progress.                               |
| Partially succeeded | Successes remain fully actionable.                    | Failed filter, Retry failed, Cancel remaining.                            |
| Succeeded           | All available outputs shown.                          | Export batch and duplicate/adjust actions.                                |
| Failed with zero    | Compact neutral failure states, no fake image.        | Correct model/settings recovery action.                                   |
| Cancelling          | Pending and in-flight local slots visibly cancelled.  | Explain provider-side compute may continue, but late output is discarded. |
| Cancelled           | Earlier successful outputs remain visible.            | Duplicate the batch to regenerate cancelled targets.                      |
| Interrupted         | Durable successes remain; unknown slots marked.       | Resume polling only when supported, otherwise retry.                      |
| Missing local file  | Broken output isolated with recovery indicator.       | Never claim downloadable success.                                         |

Progress text includes succeeded, failed, cancelled/interrupted and total counts. Color
is supplementary; icons and text communicate every non-success state.

## Selection And Review

- Clicking an image selects it for detail; checkbox/multi-select mode supports range and
  additive keyboard selection without changing grid geometry.
- The selected tile uses border plus check state, not color alone.
- No selection: the right drawer stays closed unless the user requests settings or history.
- One focused output: one `More` trigger and right-click expose image actions; those actions
  are absent from the default canvas chrome.
- One selection: the lightbox shows a large preview and direct image actions; provenance
  remains associated with the selected output and batch without occupying a third column.
- Multiple selection: the contextual action bar shows aggregate count and applicable bulk
  actions, not misleading single-output provenance.
- Bottom contextual bar exposes favorite, set as reference, download, export selected
  and clear selection. Delete is visually separated and always confirms scope.
- “调整后生成” creates a child draft/batch; it never mutates historical provenance.

## Filtering And Performance

- Primary filters: current batch, all local outputs, favorites and failures.
- Secondary filters: date, source Prompt, model, batch status and favorites.
- Sort: newest, oldest and batch/slot order where meaningful.
- Density control changes stable tile dimensions and column count without reloading
  originals.
- Result wall uses `@tanstack/react-virtual` or an equivalent existing project pattern,
  mounts only visible media and requests thumbnails before originals.
- 10,000 metadata records and a 100-output active batch must not mount all images or make
  queue controls unresponsive.

## Keyboard And Accessibility

- All composer fields, tabs, tiles, menus and batch actions are reachable by keyboard.
- Icon-only actions use Lucide icons plus tooltip and accessible name.
- Grid tiles expose output status, position and selection through semantics, not only
  visual overlays.
- Progress uses determinate semantics when total is known and announces terminal state
  changes without announcing every thumbnail insertion.
- Focus returns to the triggering control after dialogs/sheets close.
- Reduced/off motion settings use existing PromptHub motion tokens and never remove
  state feedback.

## Destructive And Local-Only Copy

- Prompt deletion confirmation states that generated work remains local and keeps its
  historical Prompt snapshot.
- Batch/output deletion confirmation names exact item count and never implies cloud
  deletion because no cloud copy exists in the first release.
- Workbench and Data Settings disclose that generation assets stay on this device and
  are excluded from remote sync.
- “添加到 Prompt” explains that the selected image becomes normal Prompt media; it does
  not upload the rest of the batch.
- Future membership/cloud controls are absent, not disabled placeholders.

## Required Component/E2E Scenarios

1. Enter directly, submit an adhoc 4-image batch and observe progressive durable output.
2. Enter from a variable image Prompt, resolve variables and retain Prompt version
   provenance after the Prompt changes.
3. Run a 50-image partial-success batch, select successes, export and retry only failures.
4. Cancel with one provider request in flight and verify honest cancelling/final counts.
5. Navigate to relationship graph and back while generation continues.
6. Restart with completed and running slots; verify successful assets and interrupted
   recovery actions.
7. Delete the source Prompt; verify workbench images remain and live link is detached.
8. Add one output to a Prompt; verify only that Prompt media enters existing sync input.
9. Exercise `1440x900`, `1100x700` and `800x600` without overlap, clipped controls or
   horizontal page scrolling.
10. Exercise keyboard-only selection, detail, retry, favorite, export and delete flows.
