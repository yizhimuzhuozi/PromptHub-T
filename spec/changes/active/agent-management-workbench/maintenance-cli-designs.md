# Agent Management Maintenance CLI Designs

This file is a supporting design record within
`spec/changes/active/agent-management-workbench/`. It does not create a second
platform registry, executable inventory, or package-manager state store.

## `DES-AGENT-049`: Read-Only CLI Diagnostics

The retained maintenance service is intentionally internal and read-only. It detects an
allowlisted Agent executable, runs only that platform's declared version
command, and returns a bounded typed diagnostic to main-process callers. The
general Agent workspace does not expose this service as a product feature.

### Source Of Truth

- `packages/shared/constants/platforms.ts` owns each built-in platform's
  optional CLI descriptor: executable candidates, version arguments and
  evidence identifier.
- `packages/shared/constants/agent-platform-capabilities.ts` derives
  `maintenanceCli` from that descriptor. It must not maintain another platform
  id allowlist.
- The main process owns command resolution and execution. Renderer code cannot
  request a generic diagnostic or lifecycle operation: no matching IPC channel
  or preload method is registered.
- Custom Agents stay unsupported until a native file-picker-backed executable
  registration contract is designed. A renderer-provided arbitrary path is
  not an acceptable substitute.

### Detection Contract

For a declared built-in descriptor, the main process checks candidates in
registry order. Resolution uses at most 256 deduplicated PATH, package-manager
and standard executable directories, does not launch the candidate merely to
locate it, and canonicalizes the first executable file it can access.
Execution uses argument arrays without a shell, a 5-second timeout and a
64 KiB limit on each captured stream. The first successful version response
wins. The public result includes only:

- status: `installed`, `not-installed`, `unhealthy` or `unsupported`;
- the resolved executable path;
- one normalized, length-bounded version line;
- a coarse installation source inferred from the resolved path;
- a stable error code and check timestamp.

Raw stderr, thrown errors, environment values and command output beyond the
normalized version line never leave the internal service boundary. Timeout, oversized output and
non-zero exit are `unhealthy`; an unresolved executable is `not-installed`;
platforms without a descriptor are `unsupported`.

The service checks at most the small, fixed candidate list for one platform.
With `c` candidates, at most `p = 256` search directories, at most four Windows
extensions and bounded captured output `b`, lookup is `O(c * p)` on Unix or
`O(c * p * 4)` on Windows, and memory is `O(p + b)`. All terms except the
registry candidate count are hard bounded. There is no network request,
recursive filesystem scan, retry loop or persistent cache.

### CC Switch Reuse Boundary

PromptHub adapts the useful CC Switch v3.18.0 idea of checking the executable
that is actually first in the user's environment rather than assuming the
package-manager prefix is active. PromptHub does not copy CC Switch's Rust
command layer, Tauri IPC, database schema or screens. The implementation uses
PromptHub's canonical platform registry and Electron main-process boundary.

### Verification

`TEST-AGENT-067` historically covered registry derivation, PATH and prefix-like resolved
locations, version normalization, candidate fallback, unsupported platforms,
missing executables, timeout/non-zero/oversized failures and redaction. The
former IPC and renderer dialog coverage was retired when the user-facing
diagnostics feature was withdrawn.

`T-AGENT-103` delivers this read-only batch. It does not close
`T-AGENT-029` or `TEST-AGENT-016`, which still require explicit install/update
plans, confirmation, post-write verification and failure recovery.

### OpenClaw evidence expansion

OpenClaw joins the same read-only diagnostic contract through its official
global `-V` / `--version` flag. The canonical descriptor uses only
`openclaw --version`; it does not run onboarding, Gateway, update, repair,
plugin, Skill or session commands. Official installation and update
documentation also proves richer lifecycle commands, but PromptHub keeps those
mutating paths unavailable until `T-AGENT-029` defines a separate
plan/confirm/apply/verify/rollback workflow.

Evidence:

- <https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli>
- <https://docs.openclaw.ai/install>
- <https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/update>

`TEST-AGENT-068` fixes the exact executable, argument and evidence declaration
and proves that the derived capability is `partial`, not a claim that
installation or updates are implemented. `T-AGENT-104` adds only this
evidence-backed descriptor and updates the current platform inventory.

## `DES-AGENT-059`: Confirmed OpenCode CLI Update

The first mutating maintenance slice is limited to OpenCode because its
official CLI contract documents both `opencode upgrade` and exact-version
recovery through `opencode upgrade v<previous-version>`. Install automation and
updates for other Agent CLIs remain disabled until their installation-source
and exact recovery contracts have equivalent evidence.

### Plan And Apply Boundary

- `packages/shared/constants/platforms.ts` remains the only command descriptor
  owner. OpenCode declares fixed update arguments, a fixed rollback target
  prefix and its official evidence id; renderer code cannot provide any of
  them.
- Planning reuses the read-only diagnostic, requires a healthy semantic
  version and creates a main-owned one-shot plan bound to the requesting
  renderer. The renderer receives a detached review copy containing the
  executable, fixed arguments, current version, detected install source and
  five-minute expiry.
- Main keeps at most 32 pending plans. It removes a plan before awaiting the
  command, so replay and concurrent apply cannot execute it twice. Apply
  re-diagnoses the executable and exact version; any change invalidates the
  plan before mutation.
- Execution never uses a shell, inherits no renderer-provided environment or
  argument, times out after 120 seconds and caps each command result at
  256 KiB. The UI requires a separate confirmation after showing the exact
  command.
- A successful command is followed by a fresh diagnostic. Verification
  failure or a partially mutating command failure attempts the captured exact
  rollback command and verifies both executable path and version. Failed
  recovery returns a stable manual-recovery code; raw output, errors and
  credentials never cross IPC.

Planning and applying inspect one fixed platform descriptor and perform a
constant number of bounded diagnostics/commands, so CPU and memory are
`O(1)` with respect to user data. Pending memory is bounded by 32 small plans.
There is no recursive scan, package inventory, retry loop or persistent
maintenance state.

### Evidence And Scope

Official OpenCode CLI evidence:

- <https://opencode.ai/docs/cli/>

`TEST-AGENT-078` covers detached plan immutability, sender ownership, expiry,
capacity, replay/concurrency, changed preconditions, fixed arguments,
successful/no-change verification, exact rollback, rollback failure,
redaction, IPC/preload, UI confirmation and all seven locales.
`T-AGENT-114` delivers only OpenCode update. It advances but does not close
`T-AGENT-029` or aggregate `TEST-AGENT-016`: installation and all other CLI
update lifecycles remain explicitly unavailable.

## `DES-AGENT-063`: Confirmed npm-managed Codex CLI Update

Codex has several official installation channels, but they do not share one
exact recovery command. This slice therefore supports only an active
npm-managed Codex executable whose canonical path is classified as `npm` or
`node-version-manager`. Homebrew casks, standalone installer releases, direct
downloads, system packages, pnpm, user-local and unknown paths remain
diagnostic-only.

### Canonical command ownership

`packages/shared/constants/platforms.ts` remains the sole command descriptor
owner. The Codex descriptor contains:

- fixed `npm` executable candidates;
- accepted active installation-source classes;
- `install -g @openai/codex@latest` update arguments;
- `install -g @openai/codex@<captured-version>` rollback construction;
- official Codex and npm evidence identifiers.

The renderer supplies only the Agent id and later the opaque plan id. It
cannot supply a package name, version, executable, manager, argument,
environment value, registry URL or shell text.

### Plan, verification and recovery

Planning diagnoses the active `codex`, requires a semantic version, rejects an
unsupported source, resolves `npm` independently, and captures both canonical
executables plus immutable update and rollback arguments in a main-owned
five-minute plan. The public review shows the exact package-manager command,
current version and diagnosed source.

Apply consumes the one-shot plan before awaiting work. It re-diagnoses the
same active Codex executable and version, then runs the captured npm command
without a shell under the existing 120-second and 256 KiB limits. Success is
accepted only when the same active Codex path remains healthy and reports a
semantic version. A command failure that left the original path/version
unchanged returns a bounded failure without a needless rewrite. Any changed,
missing or unhealthy post-state attempts the captured exact-version npm
rollback and verifies the original path and version. Failure returns only a
stable public code.

This uses a constant number of bounded command resolutions and executions, so
CPU and memory are `O(1)` with respect to user data. It adds no recursive
package scan, network preflight, retry loop, persistent updater state, elevated
privilege request or renderer-visible command output. npm performs its own
network operation only after explicit confirmation.

### Evidence and verification

Primary evidence:

- <https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/README.md>
- <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install>

`TEST-AGENT-081` covers registry ownership, accepted and rejected installation
sources, missing npm, detached review plans, fixed arguments, precondition
changes, same-path verification, exact rollback, partial command failures,
redaction, replay and renderer ownership. `T-AGENT-118` implements only this
Codex npm update path. It advances `TEST-AGENT-016` and `T-AGENT-029`; Codex
install, Homebrew/standalone updates and other Agent lifecycle commands remain
disabled until an equally exact recovery contract exists.

## `DES-AGENT-065`: Confirmed npm-managed Qwen Code CLI Update

Qwen Code reuses the same main-owned lifecycle engine as Codex, but keeps its
own registry descriptor and package identity. Only an active executable
classified as `npm` or `node-version-manager` is eligible. The fixed update is
`npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest`; rollback replaces the dist-tag
with the captured semantic version.

Planning resolves `qwen` and `npm` independently, returns a detached five-minute
review plan and performs no mutation. Apply consumes the plan once, rechecks the
same executable and version, runs without a shell under the existing 120-second
and 256 KiB limits, then verifies the same executable. A failed command that
left the original state intact returns a bounded failure; a changed, missing or
unhealthy state runs the captured exact-version npm command and verifies
restoration. Standalone scripts, Homebrew, source builds, system paths and
unknown locations remain diagnostic-only because they do not share this
recovery contract.

The operation performs a constant number of bounded command resolutions and
executions, so CPU and memory are `O(1)` in user data. It adds no persistent
updater state, recursive scan, network preflight, retry loop or renderer-owned
arguments. PromptHub adapts the public package-manager workflow and does not
copy or vendor Qwen Code source.

Primary evidence:

- <https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/en/users/support/troubleshooting/>
- <https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/en/users/quickstart/>
- <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install>

`TEST-AGENT-083` covers registry ownership, eligible and ineligible sources,
missing npm, immutable review, precondition changes, same-path verification,
partial failure and exact rollback. `T-AGENT-120` implements only this npm
update path; Qwen installation and non-npm updates remain unavailable.

## `DES-AGENT-138`: Internal CLI Maintenance Boundary

The Agent overflow menu keeps only product commands such as refresh and edit.
The diagnostics dialog, update review UI, renderer state and localized UI
entry are removed. The preload API and shared IPC channel registry expose no
CLI diagnostic, update-plan or update-apply methods, and main startup registers
no matching handlers.

The existing diagnostic and lifecycle service modules remain main-process
infrastructure. Their executable allowlist, shell-free argument arrays,
timeouts, output limits, plan ownership, expiry and rollback checks remain
covered by service-level tests. Reintroducing any user-facing update action
requires a separate platform-specific design; the internal service is not
itself evidence that a product action is available.

Removing the UI and three constant-time IPC registrations changes no persisted
state, starts no process and performs no filesystem or network work. Runtime
and memory cost for the removed path become `O(0)` until an internal caller
explicitly invokes the retained bounded service.
