# Legacy Upgrade Recovery Audit Design

<!-- traceability: enforced -->

## `DES-LEGACYREC-001`: Evidence And Fixture Boundary

Generate fixtures from tagged source contracts rather than preserving binaries
from a user's machine. A fixture manifest records source tag, artifact kind,
platform, logical path, schema/table inventory, expected row counts, stable
content hashes, and Prompt-version order. Fixture builders create deterministic
SQLite/JSON/filesystem layouts in test-owned temporary directories.

The harness first asserts that the fixture represents the historical condition,
then executes it through the current implementation. A report is reproduced only
when the current observable invariant fails; issue text or a matching path alone
is not sufficient.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-002`: Ownership And Dependency Direction

- `packages/core/src/runtime-paths.ts` remains the owner of canonical current
  runtime paths and legacy fallback helpers shared across products.
- `packages/db` remains the owner of SQLite schema, migrations, integrity checks,
  and Prompt-version row invariants.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/recovery-paths.ts` and the adjacent recovery,
  data-layout, and upgrade-backup services own desktop legacy candidate
  enumeration, read-only inspection, staging, and native restore orchestration.
- `packages/shared` owns typed recovery contracts only when a reproduced fix
  changes the renderer/main boundary.
- The renderer presents candidates and confirmation state; it does not choose a
  durable source or implement migration rules.

This corrects the earlier generic proposal to move candidate discovery into
`packages/core`. Desktop-specific Windows installation history and Electron
orchestration stay in the desktop main process unless another product proves a
shared requirement.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-003`: Issue #89 Path Transition Test

Repository tags show that v0.4.7 could use an install-scoped `data` directory,
while v0.4.8 excluded the default per-user Windows install directory under
`AppData\\Local\\Programs` and fell back to roaming application data. The issue
comments report the same transition.

The fixture therefore contains two independent roots:

1. a valid legacy v0.4.7 dataset under the install directory;
2. an empty or newer current roaming root selected by current runtime rules.

Current `getRecoveryCandidatePaths` already allowlists the legacy install path.
The test must prove candidate visibility, source provenance, cancel-without-write,
explicit recovery, record equality, and restart behavior before any production
change is considered. It must also cover a custom install directory, case-folded
duplicates, a missing path, a locked database, and a corrupt candidate.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-004`: Issue #97 Artifact Routing

The historical v0.5.1 portable backup and v0.5.2 portable backup both declare
backup format version 1 and contain an explicit `versions` collection. The
v0.5.2 automatic upgrade snapshot is a different directory artifact with a
manifest and copied user-data entries. They must not share a guessed parser.

The v0.5.1 JSON fixture runs through the current portable import path. The
v0.5.2 directory fixture runs through upgrade-backup inventory and restore. Both
must validate before publication, create the existing safety point, preserve
records and media references after restart, and restore the previous current
state after injected failure.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-005`: Issue #98 History Invariant

Current `PromptDb.getVersions` orders all matching rows by version and has no
oldest/latest limit. Current UI tests also render an intermediate version. The
remaining risk is therefore the legacy import/migration chain, identity mapping,
or a tagged data-shape edge case rather than the current query alone.

The fixture uses versions 1 through 4 with distinct IDs, timestamps, content,
variables, and notes. Verification compares the ordered database inventory,
IPC result, history UI, restart result, and intermediate rollback. Row-count-only
assertions are insufficient because duplicate or substituted versions can keep
the same count.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-006`: Minimal Remediation And Rollback

Do not add a second recovery engine from this historical-fixture change before
the tagged tests fail. The separate `database-migration-safety` change owns
current shared migration correctness independent of those results. A reproduced
historical gap is fixed in its existing owner:

- path enumeration or candidate metadata in desktop recovery services;
- SQLite migration/history integrity in `packages/db`;
- portable artifact parsing/import in the existing backup service;
- renderer behavior only when durable data and IPC are already correct.

Recovery copies the selected source into a task-owned staging directory, applies
the existing migration there, validates SQLite and domain invariants, produces a
preview, creates the established insurance snapshot, and atomically publishes.
Failures clean staging and retain the active source. Retry uses the same source
identity and is idempotent.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-007`: Capacity And Performance

For `K` fixed candidate roots, enumeration is `O(K)` plus bounded metadata work.
Prompt-history validation is `O(V)` for `V` versions. Artifact staging is
`O(B)` time and temporary disk for `B` accepted bytes, with one staged copy and
no full-byte in-memory copy. Test parameters set finite limits for candidate
count, depth, entries, bytes, and concurrency.

If remediation touches recursive candidate inspection, that path must gain and
test explicit traversal limits rather than inheriting an unbounded filesystem
walk.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-008`: Empty Prompt Version-Chain Repair

Keep the positive-version canonical resource contract strict. Repair the legacy
SQLite invariant in `packages/db` before the canonical graph is materialized:

1. insert one version-1 snapshot from each Prompt row that has no version rows;
2. align each Prompt counter to its highest positive stored version;
3. record the named migration in the existing migration transaction.

The repair uses two set-based SQL statements and is idempotent. For `P` Prompts
and `V` version rows, the indexed existence and maximum-version work is bounded
by the database query plan rather than per-Prompt application queries; no Prompt
payloads are loaded into application memory. Existing valid version rows are
not rewritten or deleted.

Canonical publication invokes source-database preparation only after the
renderer migration gate, authority check, and source-file safety check pass.
Preparation opens the source through `initDatabase()`, applies the normal
migration transaction, and closes it before the projector reads the source.
Preparation failure stops publication, so an invalid pre-migration graph cannot
become the canonical authority.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-009`: Empty Rule Placeholder Boundary

Keep Rule resource validation strict and narrow the projector input instead.
The projector omits a Rule only when all placeholder signals agree:

- `sync_status` is `target-missing`;
- `current_version` is zero;
- neither managed nor target content exists; and
- no version history exists.

This is a constant-time decision per already-enumerated Rule and does not add
filesystem scans or database queries. Records with any durable content or
history continue through the canonical schema and therefore cannot bypass the
positive-version invariant.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-010`: Explicit Coexistence Artifacts

The canonical readers use exact-name, exact-type exclusions for artifacts that
are independently owned in the shared data root:

- Prompt graph inventory skips root `.versions` only when it is a non-symlink
  directory owned by the legacy Prompt workspace;
- Prompt graph inventory skips root `agent-appearance` only when it is a
  non-symlink directory owned by Agent appearance themes and pets;
- MCP bundle enumeration skips `market-sources.json` only when it is a
  non-symlink regular file owned by the MCP market source registry, and skips
  the superseded `library.json` only when it is a non-symlink regular file;
- Plugin bundle enumeration skips superseded `library.json`,
  `market-cache.json`, and `versions.json` only when each entry is a
  non-symlink regular file.

No prefix or extension-wide exclusion is allowed. Prompt graph verification
continues to hash every declared file and reject other undeclared files. MCP
and Plugin enumeration count only bundle directories against their resource
limits. All scans remain linear in the number of root entries plus owned files.

The production MCP and Plugin service readers add a one-time compatibility
step above raw bundle enumeration. They first validate and read canonical
state. If canonical resources exist, they delete only the exact superseded
metadata files and keep canonical state authoritative. If canonical state is
empty, they parse the superseded library through the existing normalization,
publish all records through the existing journaled bundle writer, verify the
published state, and only then remove the old metadata. MCP credentials pass
through the existing device-bound secret store and are never copied into bundle
JSON. A parse, validation, secret-store, package, or publication failure occurs
before cleanup, so the old library remains available for retry. The migration
is `O(R + P)` for `R` records and bounded Plugin package files `P`, with one
journaled publication and no network work.

Renderer persistence permits a null `selfHostedDeviceId` before self-hosted
sync is configured. Canonical MCP bindings and Plugin projections therefore use
the persisted device ID when available and otherwise derive a deterministic,
root-scoped local identity. Malformed non-null IDs, symlinks, and identity
mismatches remain fail-closed.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-011`: Older Writer And Invalid Authority Gate

Compare the current application version with the durable last-writer version
before opening SQLite or initializing any workspace writer. A strictly older
application fails closed and must not rewrite the marker downward. Version
comparison must use the repository's prerelease-aware version utility rather
than numeric splitting.

The main-process recovery handler carries the startup diagnosis into an explicit
`prompt-graph` or `canonical-storage` recovery scope. The authority service keeps
`prompt-graph` as its default and refuses to replace a valid Prompt graph unless
the user selected the current SQLite candidate after an
`invalid-canonical-storage` diagnosis. This preserves file authority for all
ordinary callers while allowing the selected catalog to repair non-Prompt
canonical damage. Candidate discovery is not part of normal renderer startup:
the main process owns migration, validation, and deterministic self-heal before
SQLite opens, while the existing recovery browser is mounted only from the Data
Settings workflow. Canonical invalidity continues to ignore any legacy dismiss
marker, so no durable validation gate is bypassed.

An existing canonical authority marker is necessary but not sufficient. Startup
validates the complete file graph before opening SQLite. SQLite is a derived
catalog: a valid canonical graph is staged into a fresh catalog on startup and
the live database is replaced through the canonical entry publication journal
only when its authoritative hashes differ or it cannot be read. Readable
compatibility and operational tables are copied into the staged catalog; an
unreadable derived catalog is discarded rather than promoted to authority.
Reconciliation is a bounded `O(E + B)` scan over canonical entries `E` and
their bytes `B`, plus one staged SQLite image; it performs no network work and
uses atomic catalog publication rather than in-place mutation.

For the observed older-writer failure, startup first treats the current Markdown
workspace as a deterministic repair input. It builds a private catalog from the
exact file Prompt set, supplements only same-id history from a readable SQLite
image, materializes a new Prompt graph, and copies all independently owned
canonical domains without re-projecting them. The complete candidate is checked
and published by the existing journaled storage restore, preserving the prior
data tree as a recovery artifact. This keeps device secrets out of the repair
dependency graph and makes a malformed MCP secret non-blocking.

Known empty legacy Rule containers (`rules/.versions` and `rules/projects`)
may coexist with Rule bundles, but only as regular empty directories. A
non-empty, symlinked, or type-substituted container is ambiguous and remains
fail-closed. Derived SQLite also normalizes two file-valid compatibility cases
without rewriting their bundles: an orphaned server Skill owner is projected
as null unless the preserved server-authoritative user row exists, and among
duplicate active Agent profile names on one platform only the newest
`updatedAt` value (then greatest id) remains active while older profiles are
projected archived. These are catalog-view decisions; file metadata remains
unchanged.

The current Prompt Markdown workspace is the preferred candidate when it has
readable Prompt files. Recovery creates a private consistent image of the
closed SQLite catalog, replaces the image's current Prompt rows with the exact
file set, removes database-only Prompts, and retains only history attached to a
remaining file Prompt id. The source workspace is read-only throughout this
process. The staged catalog exists only to reuse the established canonical
projector for validated supplemental history and non-Prompt domains; it is not
allowed to choose or overwrite current Prompt content.

The observed installed-version layout contains both the superseded canonical
Prompt bundle directories and the legacy Markdown tree in `data/prompts`.
During this repair only, the strict Markdown scanner skips a top-level directory
when both `manifest.json` and `prompt.json` are regular non-symlink files. These
directories are never imported as Markdown input: they remain in the preserved
recovery artifact and are removed only inside the staged replacement before the
new graph is materialized. Partial lookalikes, nested undeclared files outside
that exact shape, symlinks, and special files remain fail-closed.

Media resolution still prefers the exact filename across the active asset root
and allowlisted recovery roots. When no filename copy exists, it may consult
only the superseded canonical bundle with the same Prompt id. The generic bundle
reader validates every payload and identity; the Prompt schema validates the
kind/reference mapping; the object reader then verifies the declared SHA-256 and
byte size from `data/assets/objects`. The validated source map is cached once per
Prompt for the repair run. This immutable-object fallback supplies bytes only
and cannot select canonical Prompt text or metadata over Markdown.

Prompt media resolution uses a fixed list: active assets, validated recovery
artifacts, and validated upgrade safety points. Resolution is by safe relative
reference and regular file only. Every existing copy is streamed through
SHA-256; a missing reference or differing hashes aborts staging. This scan is
`O(P + V + M * R)` for Prompt files `P`, retained version rows `V`, referenced
media `M`, and bounded trusted roots `R`, with constant-size hash buffers and no
network work. A successful staged graph is published through the existing
journaled authority boundary, which preserves the damaged active root.

The repair runs automatically only when the Markdown set is unique, strictly
parseable, bounded, and all referenced media resolve to identical hashes across
allowlisted roots. Any ambiguity returns `recovery-required` without modifying
the active tree. When the user explicitly opens recovery in Settings, file
candidates sort ahead of SQLite regardless of modification time. SQLite-only
recovery remains a lower-priority explicit fallback.

Strict workspace staging treats the file Folder and Prompt parent graphs as
exact sets and imports both in linear parent-before-child order. It rejects
cycles, missing parents, symlinks, special files, undeclared files, files over
16 MiB, and inventories over 100,000 entries. A database migration intent
prevents a new cooperating client from opening during replacement; existing
live or unknown client leases block publication. The full repair also uses the
storage-maintenance intent already owned by the journaled restore.

After canonical authority is restored, legacy workspace bootstrap is read-only:
it reports catalog counts but never exports SQLite into `data/prompts`. This
removes the reverse write that otherwise introduces undeclared Markdown files
and invalidates the canonical graph on the next launch.

MCP target-binding ids are opaque synchronization keys derived from target,
scope, and an absolute path. Canonical projection therefore validates their
length and control characters but does not apply resource-path separator rules.
If any recovery path closes SQLite and then fails, it reopens the original
catalog and re-registers all IPC handlers before returning the error. Handler
registration is captured transactionally at runtime: the next registration
removes the preceding successful set, and a failed partial attempt removes its
own captured set before rethrowing. This covers nested registration modules
without a drifting channel list and prevents renderer stores from retaining
services backed by the closed connection.

SQLite recovery resolves MCP input before checkpoint projection through a
read-only compatibility selector. Existing canonical bundles are read with the
desktop device secret adapter; when they are empty, the selector parses the
exact superseded MCP library with a 16 MiB bound and without publishing or
deleting it. Checkpoint materialization extracts credential values and the
existing encrypted secret sink persists them before journaled publication.

`registerAllIPC` re-registers database and non-database groups together, so its
reset inventory covers every channel owned by those groups. This is broader
than the database dependency itself but is required for idempotent recovery;
otherwise the first omitted channel aborts the rebind and leaves SQLite open
without usable renderer handlers.

The 0.6.0 application can enforce this contract for its own and future version
markers, but it cannot retrofit startup refusal into an already distributed
0.5.9 binary. Manual launch of 0.5.9 against a 0.6.0 data root therefore remains
a compatibility limitation; 0.6.0 must recover the resulting invalid authority
without claiming that the old executable was prevented from writing.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-012`: AI Model File Authority And Bounded Self-Heal

Renderer migration treats a populated legacy `config/ai-models.json` as the
pre-migration provider/model authority. Default arrays created by Zustand are
not evidence that the user deleted the file inventory, so they cannot suppress
it. Once migration succeeds, `config/providers.json` plus the encrypted vault
become the canonical owner and `ai-models.json` remains a redacted compatibility
document.

Already-affected beta roots have an exact corruption signature: canonical
models are empty while one or more route ids remain. Startup inspects at most
five upgrade safety points retained by the aggregate policy, newest first, reading only a
regular `config/ai-models.json` no larger than 8 MiB. A candidate is eligible
only when its model ids contain the complete routed-id set. The selected
provider/model inventory is republished through `RendererPersistenceStore`, so
credential encryption, staged rename, rollback, and verification remain owned
by the existing persistence boundary. The repair is `O(C * (M + B))` for at
most five candidates `C`, model records `M`, and bounded config bytes `B`; it
does no network work and does not read SQLite. No exact candidate means no
write, which distinguishes repair from ordinary user-directed restore.

## `DES-LEGACYREC-013`: Managed Skill Symlink Reconciliation

Canonical Skill startup materializes each portable bundle at the stable
`cache/skill-workspaces/<skill-id>` path before downstream reconciliation.
Platform activation files retain the exact Skill id and name that PromptHub
distributed. Startup joins those two file-owned identities and inspects only
the corresponding direct child in each configured Agent Skill directory.

A link is eligible only when its activation key, record name, current Skill
name, and Skill id all agree, and its stored target
is an exact direct-child legacy managed repository at
`data/skills/<container>/repo`. The replacement workspace and its `SKILL.md`
must both be regular non-symlink entries inside the canonical workspace root.
PromptHub creates a same-directory staged symlink, rechecks the original target,
and atomically renames the stage over the old link. A failed precondition or
rename leaves the original link unchanged. Ordinary external broken links are
not adopted.

Activation input is a regular non-symlink file no larger than 1 MiB with at
most 512 records. With fixed platform count `P`, activation records `A`, and
current Skills `S`, reconciliation is `O(S + P * A)` time and `O(S + A)`
bounded memory, performs no recursive traversal or network work, and emits at
most one startup summary rather than one exception per dangling link.

## Analyze Result

- #89 has a credible tag-backed path-transition explanation and a matching
  current recovery candidate path, but end-to-end recovery remains unproven.
- #97 combines two different artifact types; compatibility must be verified
  independently for each.
- #98 is not explained by the current all-version query. No query or schema
  change is justified until the tagged history fixture fails.
- The user-confirmed recovery boundary treats files as the only durable local
  authority. Current Prompt Markdown is the deterministic migration input when
  an older writer damaged canonical Prompt bundles; SQLite is a rebuildable
  index plus optional same-id history and operational-table supplement.
