# MCP Version History And Projection Safety Delta

## Added Requirements

### `FR-MCPVER-001`: Formal My MCP version history

PromptHub MUST maintain immutable, monotonically numbered versions for every My
MCP server. A version represents the normalized MCP server definition, not an
Agent's whole configuration file and not the MCP library schema number.

#### Scenario: Existing library migration

- **Given** a version-1 MCP library with existing servers and no version history
- **When** PromptHub completes the MCP history migration
- **Then** each existing server has an initial `v1` snapshot matching its
  current normalized definition
- **And** no Agent or project target file is modified
- **And** reopening PromptHub returns the same current server and version
  numbers

#### Scenario: Create or import a server

- **Given** a new MCP server is created, installed, or imported into My MCP
- **When** the library mutation succeeds
- **Then** PromptHub records `v1` as the current version
- **And** the current server and version snapshot have the same semantic digest

#### Scenario: Real configuration change

- **Given** a My MCP server already has a current version
- **When** transport, command, args, cwd, env, URL, headers, enabled state,
  source baseline, or other versioned definition data changes
- **Then** PromptHub creates exactly one next version
- **And** version numbers are never reused after deletion

#### Scenario: Metadata-only or byte-identical change

- **Given** only favorite state, personal tags, personal notes, or timestamps
  change, or the normalized definition is unchanged
- **When** PromptHub saves the server
- **Then** no new MCP version is created

### `FR-MCPVER-002`: Version management workflow

PromptHub MUST support listing, inspecting, comparing, manually annotating,
restoring, and deleting MCP versions without mutating historical payloads in
place.

#### Scenario: Restore an earlier version

- **Given** an MCP server has versions `v1` through `v4`
- **When** the user restores `v2`
- **Then** PromptHub preserves `v1` through `v4`
- **And** creates `v5` from the restored definition with rollback provenance
- **And** makes `v5` the current version
- **And** does not automatically distribute `v5` to Agent targets

#### Scenario: Update a version note

- **Given** an immutable MCP version exists
- **When** the user edits its note
- **Then** only the note metadata changes
- **And** the snapshot digest and version number remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Delete a historical version

- **Given** a server has more than one version
- **When** the user confirms deletion of a non-current version
- **Then** that historical version is removed
- **And** its version number is not reused
- **And** PromptHub rejects deletion of the current version

### `FR-MCPVER-003`: Projection creates no persistent backup

PromptHub MUST NOT create a durable backup, snapshot, history, or sidecar when
applying or removing My MCP entries in an external Agent/project config file.

#### Scenario: Apply to an existing target

- **Given** a parseable target file with unrelated settings
- **When** PromptHub applies a changed MCP projection
- **Then** unrelated settings remain intact
- **And** the target is replaced atomically and re-read for verification
- **And** no `*.prompthub-mcp-backup-*` or centralized target snapshot is created
- **And** the result omits `backupPath`

#### Scenario: Reapply identical content

- **Given** the projected bytes equal the current target bytes
- **When** PromptHub reapplies the same MCP entries
- **Then** the target file is not rewritten
- **And** no temporary or persistent recovery artifact remains
- **And** binding metadata may still be reconciled

#### Scenario: Remove a target entry

- **Given** an Agent target contains a managed or selected external MCP entry
- **When** the user removes that entry
- **Then** only the selected entry is removed
- **And** the operation does not create a My MCP version unless the normalized
  My MCP server definition also changes
- **And** no target backup is retained

### `FR-MCPVER-004`: Failure recovery without durable target copies

PromptHub MUST keep target writes valid and recoverable without retaining a
persistent copy of the whole external configuration.

#### Scenario: Validation or binding persistence fails in process

- **Given** PromptHub has read and validated the original target bytes
- **When** target verification or binding persistence fails after replacement
- **Then** PromptHub restores the exact original bytes from process memory
- **And** verifies the restoration
- **And** removes temporary files and transaction markers
- **And** reports an explicit failure

#### Scenario: Process interruption after target rename

- **Given** the target atomic rename completed but binding persistence did not
- **When** PromptHub starts or rescans the target
- **Then** the target remains a valid native config file
- **And** reconciliation reports the entry as missing-baseline,
  externally-modified, or conflict as appropriate
- **And** PromptHub does not silently overwrite it

### `FR-MCPVER-005`: External changes use version semantics

PromptHub MUST resolve external target changes at the MCP-entry level instead
of preserving whole target files as hidden backups.

#### Scenario: Import an external entry as a new version

- **Given** a target entry maps to an existing My MCP server but differs from
  its current definition
- **When** the user chooses Import as new version
- **Then** PromptHub shows an entry-level diff
- **And** creates the next My MCP version from the selected external entry
- **And** preserves unrelated target settings outside that entry

#### Scenario: Overwrite an external entry

- **Given** a target entry differs from the current My MCP version
- **When** the user explicitly chooses Keep My MCP and overwrite target
- **Then** PromptHub projects the current version through the safe apply flow
- **And** no new My MCP version or target backup is created

### `FR-MCPVER-006`: Legacy sidecar cleanup

PromptHub MUST provide explicit cleanup for legacy files it previously created,
without treating them as valid MCP version records.

#### Scenario: Preview cleanup candidates

- **Given** known MCP target locations contain regular files matching the exact
  legacy suffix pattern
- **When** the user scans for cleanup candidates
- **Then** PromptHub lists path, size, modification time, and related live target
- **And** does not read outside allowlisted target locations
- **And** rejects symlinks, directories, null bytes, and path escapes
- **And** makes no filesystem mutation

#### Scenario: Confirm cleanup

- **Given** the user selected previewed candidates
- **When** the user confirms cleanup
- **Then** PromptHub moves only those unchanged candidate identities to the
  platform trash or approved recovery area
- **And** skips files whose identity or metadata changed after preview
- **And** leaves unselected and unknown files untouched

### `FR-MCPVER-007`: File-authoritative MCP configuration migration

PromptHub MUST keep My MCP definitions and history in canonical files. SQLite
and renderer state MUST NOT be the only copy of an MCP definition. Device-bound
secret storage owns only non-empty literal credential values.

#### Scenario: Existing library contains unconfigured credential placeholders

- **Given** a version-1 MCP library contains empty `env` or header values
- **When** PromptHub migrates it to canonical MCP bundles
- **Then** the empty placeholders remain in the canonical server and version files
- **And** only non-empty literal credentials are extracted into the encrypted vault
- **And** reopening My MCP returns every server instead of failing the whole list
- **And** Agent/project MCP files remain derived projections

#### Scenario: Device secret storage is unavailable

- **Given** canonical MCP bundles are valid but a referenced device secret is
  missing, unreadable, or bound to another unavailable device vault
- **When** the renderer requests the My MCP inventory
- **Then** PromptHub returns the file-owned definitions with credential values redacted
- **And** does not discard the server list or fall back to SQLite
- **And** execution and mutation paths that require the real credential still fail closed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### `NFR-MCPVER-001`: Bounded work

- Version list APIs MUST be paginated and load snapshot payloads on demand.
- A semantic mutation MUST be `O(S)` for a snapshot of size `S`, excluding the
  bounded index update for that server.
- Target projection MUST read and parse the target once, generate once, and
  write once only when bytes change.
- Legacy cleanup MUST scan only known target locations and process candidates in
  bounded batches without network calls.

### `NFR-MCPVER-002`: Secret boundary

- Local MCP version files MUST receive the same owner-only permission policy as
  the current MCP library where the platform supports it.
- Version history MUST follow the existing MCP secret redaction/encryption rules
  during export, backup, sync, logging, IPC, and UI preview.
- Transaction metadata MUST NOT duplicate literal MCP credentials or whole
  external target files.
- Empty credential placeholders are configuration state rather than secrets;
  canonical files may contain the key with an empty value, but never a non-empty
  literal credential.
- Renderer inventory fallback MUST expose only the existing redaction sentinel;
  it MUST NOT convert an unavailable secret into a usable empty credential.

## Compatibility Requirements

- Version-1 MCP libraries remain readable throughout migration.
- Existing target bindings and entry digests remain valid.
- Existing adjacent sidecars are not deleted automatically.
- Optional `backupPath` fields remain accepted but are deprecated and omitted
  by new MCP projection results.
