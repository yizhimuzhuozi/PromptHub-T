# PromptHub Agent Skill System Design

This document outlines the architecture and design for the "Agent Skills" system in PromptHub, inspired by Claude Code/Desktop skills and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 1. Concept Definition

### What is a "Skill"?

In PromptHub, a **Skill** is a portable, self-contained package that gives the AI agent specific capabilities. It bridges the gap between static _System Prompts_ and dynamic _MCP Tools_.

The package boundary is the Skill directory. `SKILL.md` is the required entrypoint file inside that directory, not the entire Skill. Import, install, sync, export, and distribution flows must preserve the directory tree unless a file is excluded by an explicit ignore rule.

**A Skill consists of:**

1.  **Procedural Knowledge (System Prompt)**: Instructions on _how_ to perform a task (e.g., "How to write a high-converting email").
2.  **Tool Definitions (MCP Config)**: References to required tools or full MCP server configurations (e.g., "Requires `gmail-mcp-server`").
3.  **Local Resources (Optional)**: Scripts, assets, examples, or reference documents that the agent can read.

### Analogy

- **Prompt**: A request (e.g., "Write an email").
- **MCP Tool**: The hammer (e.g., `send_email` function).
- **Skill**: The carpenter (The knowledge of _how_ to use the hammer to build a specific thing, plus the hammer itself).

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Data Model (`Skill` Entity)

```json
{
  "id": "skill_unique_id",
  "name": "Data Analysis Expert",
  "description": "Analyzes CSV files and generates charts using Python.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "User Name",
  "instruction": "You are a data analyst... [Full System Prompt content]",
  "mcp_servers": [
    {
      "name": "pandas-tool",
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_pandas_server"]
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "API_KEY": "..."
  }
}
```

### 2.1.1 Source Update Resolver Boundary

Source update checks use an explicit resolver boundary before comparing package
state. The renderer resolver classifies each source into one adapter kind:

- `remote-store`: marketplace/registry metadata that points to a source.
- `remote-git`: Git/Gitea/GitHub package source with branch/directory metadata.
- `remote-zip`: release/archive package source.
- `content-url`: raw single-file `SKILL.md` source.
- `local-linked`: external local folder used directly as the My Skills source.
- `managed-copy`: PromptHub-managed local package directory.

When a source check fails, the resolver also returns the adapter kind and a
safe display reference. The update check carries that reference with a
sanitized failure reason so local folder failures identify the missing path and
remote failures identify the endpoint without exposing credentials or query
secrets. The detail and full-detail surfaces render the same diagnostic data.

The resolver feeds the shared `B/L/R` reconciliation service. Raw `content-url`
sources are modeled as a single-file package, so their package fingerprint is
the fetched `SKILL.md` content hash rather than any registry-provided directory
fingerprint.

Each adapter must preserve its transport boundary. Local adapters read their
resolved filesystem directory. Git-backed adapters send the canonical
repo/branch/directory descriptor through the typed preload and IPC boundary;
the main process validates and clones the repository once, then returns the
`SKILL.md` content and full package fingerprint from that same snapshot. Local
directories use the same validated inventory reader, while ZIP sources use it
after bounded extraction. This path supports explicitly selected
private-network Gitea repositories without routing them through generic HTTP
content fetching. Legacy hosted-Git raw/file URLs recover repo, decoded branch,
and directory metadata before routing. A concrete imported local source path
is authoritative over colliding catalog identities. Raw content URLs continue
through the SSRF-protected HTTP fetcher, whose private-address policy is not
weakened by Git support.

Catalog recovery for an installed Skill must not treat a repository URL as a
complete Skill identity because one repository may contain many packages.
Exact source id, content URL, registry slug, verified package path, and unique
Skill name are ordered ahead of repository fallback. Ambiguous siblings never
use first-entry ordering. Successful reconciliation can repair non-empty
canonical source metadata so old truncated catalog URLs and stale ids do not
remain durable routing inputs. Remote Git snapshots also return the validated
repository-relative package directory, allowing legacy guessed directory and
canonical `SKILL.md` paths to be repaired from the package actually compared.

Agent and Project scan imports keep distribution paths separate from source
identity. A copied import uses the concrete external symlink target, when one
exists, for source checks and updates while retaining the scanned shortcut for
the downstream Agent or Project installation. A PromptHub-managed symlink keeps
its managed identity. Local validation and managed-repo copying must use the
same shared ignore predicate as package fingerprinting so dependency and
runtime artifacts cannot change source availability or package contents.

Remote text and package fetches resolve the target before direct requests so
the SSRF boundary can pin the resolved address. When a user-configured proxy
agent is active, the fetcher also accepts proxy-generated RFC 2544 `198.18/15`
compatibility answers and passes the original hostname to that agent; real
loopback and RFC1918 addresses remain blocked unless the existing exact-source
private-network policy applies.

Filesystem-backed package fingerprints are computed through the shared
`skill-package-sha256-v1` package manifest utility before desktop main or CLI
write `directory_fingerprint` / `installed_directory_fingerprint` rows. Legacy
stable-text directory hashes remain available only for compatibility tests and
old-row comparison; they must not be written with the SHA-256 algorithm label.
Git tree/API metadata that only exposes blob hashes is not enough to compute
this v1 package fingerprint, so registry loaders leave `directory_fingerprint`
empty until a clone/materialized package path can be fingerprinted.

The same validated package snapshot also supplies update-review inventory.
Each bounded entry records normalized path, byte size, SHA-256 content digest,
text/binary classification, and safe text preview content when available. The
renderer joins local and source entries by path to derive added, modified, and
removed rows; this presentation data never replaces the main-process package
validation, staging, safety, or rollback boundaries. A `skill-md` snapshot
scope limits raw content sources to the one file their update operation can
actually replace.

### 2.2 File System Structure (Export Format)

Skills can be exported as `.skill` files (ZIP archives) or simple folders to be compatible with Claude Code standards where possible.

```text
my-data-skill/
├── manifest.json      # Metadata (Name, Version, MCP config)
├── SKILL.md           # The core system prompt/instructions
└── scripts/           # (Optional) Helper scripts
```

A Skill with only `SKILL.md` is still represented as a directory:

```text
simple-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

## 3. Feature Requirements

### 3.1 Skill Installation & Discovery

#### 3.1.1 File Placement

Create one folder per skill name and put a `SKILL.md` inside it. PromptHub searches these locations:

**Project config:**

- `.prompthub/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (Claude-compatible)

**Global config:**

- `~/.config/prompthub/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (Claude-compatible)

#### 3.1.2 Discovery Mechanism

For project-local paths, PromptHub walks up from your current working directory until it reaches the git worktree root. It loads any matching `skills/*/SKILL.md` files along the way.

Global definitions are also loaded from user config directories.

#### 3.1.3 SKILL.md Format Specification

Each `SKILL.md` must start with YAML frontmatter. Only these fields are recognized:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name # Required, skill identifier
description: Brief desc # Required, 1-1024 characters
license: MIT # Optional, license type
compatibility: prompthub # Optional, compatibility flag
metadata: # Optional, string-to-string map
  audience: developers
  workflow: github
---
```

**Name Validation Rules:**

- Length: 1-64 characters
- Format: lowercase alphanumeric with single hyphen separators
- Cannot start or end with `-`
- Cannot contain consecutive `--`
- Must match the directory name containing SKILL.md
- Regex: `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`

**Example:**

Create `.prompthub/skills/git-release/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: git-release
description: Create consistent releases and changelogs
license: MIT
compatibility: prompthub
metadata:
  audience: maintainers
  workflow: github
---

## What I do

- Draft release notes from merged PRs
- Propose a version bump
- Provide a copy-pasteable `gh release create` command

## When to use me

Use this when you are preparing a tagged release.
Ask clarifying questions if the target versioning scheme is unclear.
```

#### 3.1.4 Permission Control

Control which skills agents can access using pattern-based permissions in `prompthub.json`:

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "skill": {
      "*": "allow",
      "pr-review": "allow",
      "internal-*": "deny",
      "experimental-*": "ask"
    }
  }
}
```

**Permission Types:**

| Permission | Behavior                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `allow`    | Skill loads immediately                   |
| `deny`     | Skill hidden from agent, access rejected  |
| `ask`      | User prompted for approval before loading |

Patterns support wildcards: `internal-*` matches `internal-docs`, `internal-tools`, etc.

#### 3.1.5 Override Per Agent

Give specific agents different permissions than the global defaults.

**For custom agents (in agent frontmatter):**

```yaml
---
permission:
  skill:
    "documents-*": "allow"
---
```

**For built-in agents (in prompthub.json):**

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "plan": {
      "permission": {
        "skill": {
          "internal-*": "allow"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3.1.6 Disable the Skill Tool

Completely disable skills for agents that shouldn't use them:

**For custom agents:**

```yaml
---
tools:
  skill: false
---
```

**For built-in agents:**

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "plan": {
      "tools": {
        "skill": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When disabled, the `<available_skills>` section is omitted entirely.

### 3.2 Skill Management (The "Skill Store")

- **Library View**: A grid view of installed skills.
- **One-click Install**:
  - Install from a URL (e.g., from a community Git repo).
  - Install from official/community maintained `registry.json` sources.
  - Automatic validation of skill names and format compliance.
- **Import/Export**:
  - Import from local folder/zip.
  - Export configured skills to standard format for sharing.
  - Auto-generate compliant SKILL.md files on export.
- **Create/Edit**: A GUI to define the System Prompt and configure MCP servers for the skill.

### 3.3 Integration with Chats

- When starting a new chat, users can "Equip" one or multiple Skills.
- **Effect**:
  1. The Skill's `instruction` is appended to the session's System Prompt.
  2. The Skill's defined MCP servers are started and attached to the session context.

### 3.4 Skill Builder

- Provide a graphical interface to create Skills.
- **Prompt Editor**: Write core instructions.
- **MCP Configuration**: Visually add MCP servers through forms, no need to write JSON manually.
- **Frontmatter Editor**: Graphical interface to edit skill metadata with automatic name validation.
- **Live Preview**: Preview the generated SKILL.md file format.

### 3.5 Troubleshooting

If a skill does not show up:

1. **Verify file name**: Ensure the file is named `SKILL.md` (all caps).
2. **Check frontmatter**: Ensure it includes `name` and `description` fields.
3. **Uniqueness check**: Ensure skill names are unique across all locations.
4. **Permission check**: Check permissions—skills with `deny` are hidden from agents.
5. **Directory name match**: Ensure the directory name matches the `name` field in frontmatter exactly.
6. **Format validation**: Use regex `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$` to validate name format.

### 3.6 Export & Sharing

- **Export to Bundle**: Pack the skill into a shareable JSON or ZIP.
- **Claude Code Compatibility**: Allow exporting in a format compatible with Anthropic's official `SKILL.md` structure so users can use PromptHub to author skills for the official Claude desktop app.
