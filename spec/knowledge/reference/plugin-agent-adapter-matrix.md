# Plugin Agent Adapter Matrix

## Purpose

This reference records which Agent targets have a real plugin, extension, power, or package mechanism that PromptHub can adapt to.

PromptHub Plugin support does not mean every Agent can read Codex `.codex-plugin` packages directly. It means PromptHub can scan one Plugin inventory and either install it as a native bundle package or generate the target Agent's own bundle package format.

## Semantic Gate

PromptHub must not enable a target just because its docs use the word "plugin". A supported Plugin target must have bundle semantics:

- It can declare or contain multiple child capability classes such as skills, agents, commands, hooks, MCP servers, LSP servers, app/connectors, scripts, assets, or package-level docs.
- It has a package-level manifest, import surface, marketplace, extension, or power format that represents the bundle as one installable unit.
- It can preserve the user's mental model of "install one capability pack, then inspect or distribute its child assets".

These do not qualify as first-version Plugin targets:

- a single `SKILL.md` with no additional package inventory
- a single JS/TS hook file or function
- a runtime hook module that cannot carry or point to multiple child asset groups
- an agent platform that only exposes separate skill/rule/command/MCP directories without one package format

## Classifications

| Status        | Meaning                                                                                                                               | First Implementation UI                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Native`      | Target can consume the source bundle package format directly, or nearly directly, through its own marketplace/install surface.        | Enabled                                                                                        |
| `Adapter`     | PromptHub can generate a target-native bundle package from the PromptHub Plugin inventory.                                            | Enabled only when package generation and the native install/load contract are both implemented |
| `RuntimeOnly` | Target has a plugin runtime, but the plugin is a hook/module/function surface rather than a bundle package.                           | Disabled/greyed out as unsupported for Plugin bundles                                          |
| `Composite`   | Target has useful customization surfaces, but no confirmed single integrated plugin package; PromptHub would have to split the parts. | Disabled/greyed out as unsupported for Plugin bundles                                          |
| `Pending`     | Public docs are insufficient or access is gated; do not promise support.                                                              | Disabled/greyed out unless a future audit proves bundle support                                |

## Composite Or Disabled Targets

| Target                   | Status        | Reason                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenCode                 | `RuntimeOnly` | Official docs define a plugin as a JS/TS module or npm package that exports hook functions. It is useful, but not a bundle inventory format.                                     |
| Cline SDK / CLI / Kanban | `RuntimeOnly` | Official docs define plugin entrypoints through `package.json` `cline.plugins` and `AgentPlugin` files for tools/hooks/commands, not a bundle inventory.                         |
| Windsurf / Devin         | `Composite`   | Public docs describe separate Cascade skills, workflows, hooks, MCP, and IDE/plugin surfaces, but not one confirmed Agent plugin bundle format.                                  |
| Cherry Studio            | `Composite`   | The current product renamed Plugins to Skills and exposes separate Skill/agent/MCP surfaces; no confirmed single plugin package or marketplace format is modeled.                |
| ZCode                    | `Pending`     | ZCode documents multi-capability Plugins, but the public docs do not confirm a stable local package marker or installation path for PromptHub distribution.                      |
| Amp                      | `Pending`     | The public manual confirms project/user TypeScript Plugin paths, but copying executable files does not prove Amp trust or activation; no native install/rollback adapter exists. |
| Other Agent targets      | `Pending`     | Default to greyed out until official docs or source code prove an integrated package mechanism and PromptHub defines an adapter.                                                 |

Runtime-only, composite, and pending targets should remain visible but disabled in the first Plugin implementation, with UI copy that says the target does not support PromptHub Plugin bundles. Enabling runtime-only targets requires a separate wrapper design. Enabling composite targets requires a separate composite installer design that shows which target-native surfaces will be written, backed up, and rolled back.

## Adapter Notes

- Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Kiro, and GitHub Copilot have package manifests that can carry or point to multiple child capabilities.
- OpenCode is not a first-version PromptHub Plugin adapter under the strict semantic gate because its plugin mechanism is a JS/TS or npm hook module loaded from plugin directories or `opencode.json`.
- Cline is not a first-version PromptHub Plugin adapter under the strict semantic gate because its plugin mechanism is an `AgentPlugin` runtime entrypoint package. It can still be useful later as a runtime wrapper target.
- Cline support must remain scope-labeled. The official Cline plugin docs say the plugin feature applies to Cline SDK, CLI, and Kanban, not the VSCode or JetBrains extension runtime.
- GitHub Copilot should not be treated as instruction-only anymore. Copilot CLI and VS Code Agent Plugins now define a `plugin.json` package with component paths for agents, skills, commands, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers.
- Generating `plugin.json` or copying a package under `installed-plugins/` is not
  a successful Copilot installation. PromptHub keeps read-only discovery, but
  the distribution target remains disabled until a bounded
  `copilot plugin install` adapter can confirm registration and rollback.
- Cursor's public `cursor/plugins` repository is enough to model the package shape: a root `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`, per-plugin `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, and child directories such as `skills/`, `rules/`, and `mcp.json`.
- Generating a Cursor package or copying it below `~/.cursor/plugins` is not
  sufficient activation evidence. PromptHub keeps Marketplace-cache and local
  Plugin discovery read-only and disables distribution until a native
  Marketplace or verified local-plugin adapter can confirm loading and
  rollback.
- Kiro Power package shape and native import are separate contracts. PromptHub
  keeps package inventory read-only and disables direct filesystem
  distribution until a native import adapter can preview, confirm, verify
  registration, and roll back.
