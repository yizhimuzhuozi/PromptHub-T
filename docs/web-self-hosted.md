# PromptHub Web Self-Hosted

`apps/web` is the lightweight self-hosted web edition of PromptHub.

It is intended for personal use, home lab deployments, or small single-instance setups where users want browser access to their local-first PromptHub workspace without relying on the official cloud product.

It is not the hosted commercial PromptHub Cloud stack. Keep the boundary clear:

- `apps/web`: self-hosted, simple auth, workspace files + SQLite index, user-managed deployment
- `prompthub-cloud`: official hosted SaaS, team/billing/multi-tenant/cloud operations

## Product Scope

This app provides browser-safe workspace capabilities:

- prompts, folders, prompt hierarchy, relations, and output-format sequences
- skill records, versions, safety review, import/export, and remote import
- rules, media, settings, immutable desktop backup, and legacy sync compatibility

MCP and Plugin data remains part of desktop backup and legacy synchronization payloads, but
the browser does not manage or apply those Desktop-owned resources. The web
workspace also does not expose local skill package files, agent scans,
symlinks, platform installation, or native shell operations.

It should not grow cloud-only features such as:

- billing
- team workspaces
- multi-tenant organization management
- hosted object storage orchestration
- cloud admin operations

## Desktop Backup Source

PromptHub Desktop can use this self-hosted web workspace as a personal backup and restore target.

In desktop `Settings -> Data`, configure:

- self-hosted PromptHub URL
- username
- password

Then the current desktop can:

- test the connection
- create a new immutable remote snapshot without changing the live Web workspace
- explicitly restore the latest verified snapshot after creating a local safety snapshot
- create an upload-only snapshot once on startup
- periodically create upload-only snapshots in the background

Desktop and Web versions must match exactly, and both sides must support the
same backup protocol. A mismatch skips automatic backup and blocks manual
backup/restore before local export or remote write. Automatic tasks never pull,
merge, or replace local data.

## Backup And Legacy Sync Contract

Live automatic sync selects one of `webdav` or `s3`. Self-hosted Web backup is
independent from that selection, so it can create recovery snapshots while a
single live-sync provider remains active. The persisted provider type still
accepts `self-hosted` for old settings, but the current desktop normalizes that
legacy value to `manual`.

Authenticated backup routes live under `/api/backups/desktop`. The server keeps
up to ten checksummed snapshots per user under
`DATA_ROOT/backups/desktop/<hashed-user>/`. Snapshot files are immutable,
symbolic-link paths are rejected, and the live Web database/workspace is not
imported or changed. The request limit is 50 MiB.

The snapshot contains prompt graph data, Rules, full Skill files and versions,
MCP/Plugin libraries and packages, store sources, Agent assets, inline media,
and non-secret settings. Passwords, tokens, API keys, access keys, and proxy
credentials are excluded because this channel is not encrypted as a secret
vault.

Legacy web sync operations (`PUT /sync/data`, `POST /sync/push`, and
`POST /sync/pull`) remain available for older clients and return a unified
`summary` block (`prompts`, `folders`, `rules`, `skills`). The current desktop
UI and scheduler do not call these routes for self-hosted backup.

Complete snapshots also preserve prompt relations and output-format items. When
an import skips a dangling dependency, the response includes imported/skipped
counts so a desktop client can report a partial graph restore.

Incremental WebDAV/S3 downloads verify the manifest data hash and media
hash/size before restoring local records. A mismatch or missing media file is a
failed sync, not a partial successful restore.

## First-Run Bootstrap

When a new deployment starts with an empty database:

1. The first visit goes to `/setup`, not the login page.
2. The user creates the initial administrator account there.
3. Public registration stays disabled after that first account is created.

## Configuration

Copy the example environment file first:

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
```

Install dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Important variables:

- `JWT_SECRET`: required, at least 32 characters
- `AGENT_SECRET_KEY`: optional 32-byte hex or base64 key. It is required before
  the Web Agent workspace can store Provider credentials or edit native Agent
  config files. Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`, keep it stable, and
  back it up separately from `DATA_ROOT`; losing it makes existing encrypted
  credentials and config rollback backups unreadable.
- `DATA_ROOT`: root directory for all PromptHub data (default: `./`). The app writes `data/`, `config/`, `logs/`, and `backups/` under this path.
- `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false`: keep this disabled; the first admin is created only through `/setup`
- `AUTH_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=true`: keep image captcha enabled by default. For trusted private/LAN personal deployments, set `AUTH_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=false` to remove setup/login captcha.
- `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=false`: keep this disabled unless your reverse proxy strips client-supplied forwarding headers and writes trusted `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` values.

### Auth Captcha

PromptHub Web requires an image captcha on setup and login by default. This is the recommended setting for any public or internet-reachable deployment:

```env
AUTH_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=true
```

For trusted private/LAN personal deployments, you can explicitly disable the setup/login captcha:

```env
AUTH_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=false
```

When disabled, `/api/auth/bootstrap` reports `captchaEnabled: false`, the setup/login pages hide the captcha field, and the server accepts register/login requests without `captchaId` or `captchaAnswer`. This switch does not change passwords, JWT cookies, registration policy, or auth rate limits.

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

Default ports:

- client: `http://localhost:5174`
- server: `http://localhost:3000`

## Build

```bash
pnpm build:web
pnpm --filter @prompthub/web start
```

Useful root-level commands:

- `pnpm lint:web`
- `pnpm typecheck:web`
- `pnpm test:web -- --run`
- `pnpm verify:web`
- `pnpm docker:web:build`

## Docker

`apps/web` already includes a production `Dockerfile` and ready-to-use compose files.

When a `v<version>` release tag is built in CI, PromptHub also publishes a
container image to GHCR:

- `ghcr.io/legeling/prompthub-web:<version>`
- `ghcr.io/legeling/prompthub-web:v<version>`
- `ghcr.io/legeling/prompthub-web:latest` for stable tags only

Prerelease tags such as `v0.6.0-beta.1` publish their explicit versioned image
without moving `latest`. Use the explicit prerelease tag for manual beta
testing; production deployments that track `latest` remain on the latest
stable image.

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

```bash
cd apps/web
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and set at least:

```env
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-random-secret-at-least-32-chars
AGENT_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-the-output-of-openssl-rand-hex-32
ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false
AUTH_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=true
TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=false
```

Start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Default access URL:

- `http://localhost:3871`

The compose file mounts PromptHub-managed data roots so your database, workspace files, and uploaded media stay outside the container.

Each mounted `DATA_ROOT` must be used by one Web server process at a time. The
self-hosted entry point can recover a legacy SQLite lock left by a crashed or
pre-release process, but this is not multi-replica SQLite support; do not scale
multiple containers against the same data volume.

### Deploy from the Published GHCR Image

The `latest` alias below tracks stable releases only.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/legeling/prompthub-web:latest
docker run -d \
  --name prompthub-web \
  -p 3871:3000 \
  -e JWT_SECRET='replace-with-a-random-secret-at-least-32-chars' \
  -e AGENT_SECRET_KEY='replace-with-the-output-of-openssl-rand-hex-32' \
  -e ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false \
  -e AUTH_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=true \
  -e TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=false \
  -v "$(pwd)/apps/web/data:/app/data" \
  -v "$(pwd)/apps/web/config:/app/config" \
  -v "$(pwd)/apps/web/backups:/app/backups" \
  ghcr.io/legeling/prompthub-web:latest
```

You can also deploy directly from the published image with the compose override in `apps/web`.

## Upgrade

If you deploy with Docker Compose:

```bash
cd apps/web
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

Your data remains intact as long as you keep the same mounted directories.

## Backup

The safest backup strategy is to back up the entire `DATA_ROOT`, not only the SQLite file.

Typical persisted paths include:

- `data/prompthub.db`
- `data/prompts/...`
- `data/skills/...`
- `data/assets/...`
- `config/settings/...`
- `backups/...`
- `logs/...`

## Deployment Notes

- Back up `DATA_ROOT` regularly.
- Treat this app as a user-managed deployment artifact, not as a shared hosted service.
- If you expose it to the public internet, use HTTPS and a reverse proxy in front of it.
- Only set `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` when that reverse proxy removes untrusted incoming forwarding headers; otherwise auth rate limits intentionally use a coarse fallback client bucket.
- CI selects the self-hosted Web checks from the root verification registry,
  covering lint, typecheck, tests, production build, built-artifact smoke,
  Docker image build, and compose validation.
